		<sentence> ・ The view - although the windows need cleaning or to be changed out, as they were not clear. Location is excellent. Water pressure is also excellent.</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ Bathroom space is very small for potentially 4 people. Security should be a priority, as the hotel below ground level is connected to a small inside mall, which is a huge bonus, but - it also seems to be a converging space for the homeless, who have mental health issues and addiction issues. Makes them very in-predictable and I would not have wanted to run into one of them with small kids in tow. Saw a few having episodes the next morning.</sentence>

		<sentence> ・ Location was close to the event we were attending. There is a parking structure attacked to the hotel so you did not need to park outside. You can travel with pets and our request for a mini fridge in the room for medication storage was honoured at no charge.</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ The bathroom was dated, some tiles were cracked in the shower and much of the grout was black. The carpet was stained but was not dirty(my socks did not turn get dirty walking on carpet). Parking garage has low ceilings(6 foot max clearance) so larger vehicles will not fit and cost is $19/day. There was a $40 charge for cleaning the room if you travel with pets that we were not told about until after check-in. The bar/restaurant was closed when we went to have a drink one evening and there are no posted hours of operation.u</sentence>

The hotel location itself can't be beat for the price too, it's close to Berri-Uqam Metro, there is a food court in the building and a grocery store. You're also real close to the Village, Ste Denis and other streets of interest within walking distance too.</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ Furniture in the rooms a little run down, bathroom too could do with a good scrubbing, but nothing horrific. </sentence>
		<sentence>For a none smoking hotel there were guests smoking in rooms, the smell came through the vents on the last night of our stay. A quick call to the frontdesk and they were very apologetic and said they would look in to it.</sentence>

		<sentence> ・ The biggest con for me was the pool hours. On the website it indicated 8am to noon and 6pm to 10pm (subject to change) so seeing that, we decided to call to make sure these were the correct hours which the receptionist agreed they were. Arriving that night, we see that the pool is no longer open in the morning. If we had known that prior to booking we probably wouldn’t have stayed there because we were really looking forward to our morning swim. </sentence>
		<sentence>I also think pet friendly hotels are great for all dog owners but, not if they have carpeting, I don’t think it’s appropriate flooring, it had a slight dog scent and my allergies acted up a little. I’m assuming that limits the clientel and will discourage non pet owners or whoever that isn’t bringing a pet along, to book there. But it wasn’t overly disgusting which to me means the cleaning is well done. Also the bathroom walls were kind of gross by where the garbage was under the sink, looked like someone was sick and left a dried up souvenir. </sentence>

		<sentence> ・ both pool & exercise room were shut down during our visit, which was one of the reasons we chose the hotel so were very disappointed to find out only upon check-in (though we were upgraded to a room with a better view). As well, I asked in my booking if there was a charge for our dog, which I specified we were bringing. Not only did we not hear back that there was a charge, it was only upon check-in that we were informed it was $30 extra for the dog. Management waived the $20 parking fee to compensate for this but overall, just not great communication from management.</sentence>

	<text>
		<sentence> ・ location</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ parking. If we had a car it would have been better but we drive a truck. When checking in they didn't ask us what vehicle we drove and told us to park underground in the public parking next door. Our truck didn't fit . so we spent money on a meter outside. We were then directed by the hotel to another underground parking 2 blocks away. Not happy. It could have saved us about an hour if they asked us at check in what kind of vehicle we drove and directed us there immediately. They wouldn't even budge on price. I asked for 10.00 off for our parking (meter plugged for that) because it was their error in not mentioning that trucks don't fit. and I found them unfriendly in this manner. That bad hospitality left a bad impression on me and I woulnt go back.</sentence>

The stores in Place Dupuis, especially the IGA supermarket and the pharmacy are superb, and I like the fact that I could go right into the mall without going outside the hotel.</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ This hotel is rather overpriced for a place with no fridge, no microwave, and no room safe for valuables. It would have been so nice to keep some cold beverages in my room and some snacks in the fridge. With that wonderful market there and so many good restaurants, I would also have been able to store leftovers in my room for later or the next day instead of having to waste so much food and spend so much on fresh meals everyday.</sentence>

But elevator was not working since someone was also stuck inside and fire department had to come.. so instead of waiting we took stairs which usually are safe thing to do in case of emergency but seems that it-s not the case at Gouverneur!

I think we should have been offered a special rate since the parking garage was open to the public, however the parking spots available were conveniently located. The room was very dated which was disappointing considering it wasn't cheaply priced and it was located in the heart of the city on the upper floors and it was advertised as a deluxe room. Plus we had to pay extra to have a mini fridge. The room initially wasn't cleaned to my satisfaction as I found stray hairs around in the bathroom and the carpet could have been cleaned more thoroughly.

The towels were huge. Even though we booked on line, we were offered a choice of rooms and we selected a great view from the 25th floor. When walking about the city it is easy to see and use the tall hotel as a landmark. We were there for the first night of the Jazz festival and we were surprised to even get a room on short notice. I did not get an opportunity to check out the pool or exercise area, nor did we go to the bar or restaurant as we spent as much time as possible in the city.</sentence>

		<sentence> ・ Overall the rooms and halls felt grungy and outdated. I was on the 12th floor and a friend on a higher floor had a different experience though we paid comparable rates. (See photo to highlight the laughable aesthetic differences between the two floors when you get off the elevator.) There was no mini-fridge in the room. The bathroom was dark and it had a rusty sink and stained ceilings. The lightbulb in the lamp next to my bed was burned out. Check-in is strictly at 4pm and there is a charge if you want an earlier time. Aside from the man who stored our luggage upon arrival, the staff was not friendly or accommodating. There is a park across the street with a lot of homeless people who beg as you enter and exit the hotel. There are a few cute bars and restaurants in the immediate area but it's still a bit of walk or taxi ride to get to the main tourist areas.</sentence>

	<title>The worst.</title>
	<text>
		<sentence> ・ It was one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in, starting from the confusing parking structure/elevator to the hotel ( that are not easy to navigate or properly labeled). The check-in was one of the longest I've ever had to go through. For some reason there was only one baggage cart. The room was out of date and needs to have basic repair, like the door to the bathroom did not close properly without trapping you inside. The fixtures leaked and tiles were cracked and coming out and it was moldy and dirty. The tv randomly raised in volume and wouldn't turn off without shutting off power to the entire room. The rooms were not super clean, there was mold in the bathroom, no coffee in the maker ( and it was dirty) there was even a swastika etched in the wood next to the toilet ( something that could easily been covered or removed). The area around the hotel was not the greatest and you had to walk a bit too get to all the 'tourist' spots; and I wouldn't call the area you had to walk at night super safe. The area could be loud especially if you have a room with a view. Not sure how they were rated 4 stars, but they are barely above a motel.</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ Literally everything. They need a top to bottom remodel and New management. Something's could be changed with no money just with staff attention. The hotel is a 1 star hotel.</sentence>

The room was very clean, the bed was comfortable and service was very good.</sentence>

Exhaust is filled with dust. You can feel the springs in the mattress. Bath tub area does not look clean. It felt as if it was a motel disguised in a 3 or 4 star hotel. And the parking was terrible. The height is so short our antenna above the cat was touching the ceiling and got scratched and damaged. I hope you get this in time, if you are reading this and your about to go there, RUN (in the opposite direction). Not worth it.</sentence>

		<sentence>Heard many negative comment about the type of breakfast, taste and price</sentence>
		<sentence>Definitely should have a small shuddle bus to bring client to the old port and back price maybe 5.00$ each person </sentence>
		<sentence>Schedule in the morning, afternoon and evenings </sentence>
		<sentence>(Example; bus leaves hotel 10;am and pick up 12;30 and at the same time more people from the hotel to old port </sentence>
		<sentence>Etc maybe one last pick up 21;30 or so</sentence>
		<sentence>This is a marketing gain for the hotel no other hotel gives that service client will love this new idea)think about it money and more client, small shuttle bus or small school bus do not forget wheel chair access)</sentence>

		<sentence> ・ I had a bad feeling about this the moment I entered the hotel. But I got to the front desk the lady was on the phone chatting with some friends laughing giggling definitely not paying attention to the fact that I was standing in front of part ready to check in. It was past my check in time so I am actually paying for the room while she is busy social dancing around on the phone. After giving her a few looks she finally hangs up the phone she checked me in. I had requested the room with a view but I was refused. I had also requested a microwave for the baby that was also rejected. It was apparently supposed to be a non-smoking hotel, however the room had strong smoke smell as if someone had just finished smoking. He entered the room with our six month old baby. I called and held the line for over 15 minutes before I was asked to come down and she would check me in another room. Apparently it was on the same floor as our previous room but she would not send someone upstairs with a different set of keys and let us into another room. I had to drag my child along with all my bags in order to get a different group. I did not appreciate that. It was a horrible experience I suggest you heed my words and don’t stay at this hotel so you don’t have to experience what I did for $200. I had to pay for the parking and the Wi-Fi because the free Internet was extremely slow</sentence>

They had us in the wrong room first (we asked for 2 beds and has 1 king bed instead) so we actually got to see 2 rooms on 2 different floors. They were both the same. I thought I had booked a Superior Room with 2 double beds and I don't feel like this room was superior at all.

		<sentence> ・ Poor service with bad-tempered people! I booked and paid a value for 3 nights to spend the New Year Eve with my 15 years old daughter and the stay was one of the worst in my life! Old suite with toilet flush problems! Suite smelled musty! Dirty carpet! Antique furniture, stained and infiltrating the window! Shower cools during the shower! Anyway ... lousy! I do not recommend! I had to argue about the value when I checked out because they charged higher rates and charged too 3 parking fees but I arrived by taxi! I will request a refund of the amount paid! Horrible!</sentence>

		<sentence> ・ The pool was closed - water leak, we booked it based on hotel having pool. The hotel bar closed- for the season??? We went out for the day upon our return the hotel elevators were not working. Staff wouldn’t let us walk up stairs- we missed our new year eve dinner reservations due to the delay. Eventually we were able to walk the 22 flights of stairs. This hotel is not 4 star caliber which was very disappointing to us.</sentence>

No ice machine on every floor or if you found on there was no guarantee it worked, it turned into a game of find the working ice machine. Fire alarm went off in the middle of the night for no reason. Cleaning staff kept coming into our room while we were in there sleeping, apparently we were supposed to be up and moving at 9-10. The rating the booking automatically assigns is not an accurate rating. I would really give this place a 2 out of 5 not 4.2!</sentence>

		<sentence> ・ NOTHING.DO NOT BOOK HERE!!!</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ DISGUSTING. WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED AT. This hotel states that it is a 4 star, in my opinion that is a lie. The room that I got was what i imagine a motel would be.Dirty, smelly, rude staff, photos do not match the actual hotel. The photos are from what i could tell that was the one renovated floors that the hotel has (which is classified as business) and apparently is an extra charge even though the photos for the regular double queen room has those photos. The original room I was given had live flies, cob webs, dust in the air, dust surrounding the vents etc, rotting doors, and holes in the walls . Checking in a 12 am I was extra upset. I lasted an hour in the room before i called and asked if there was another room... they then moved me to the business class room . Once i got that room, as soon as i walked into the room it was renovated BUT it was still smelly and dirty, there was a fruit pit on the floor as soon as i walked beside the bed. Called booking and basically the hotel lied to booking about what i had said and the stated that their hotel was only outdated (which was not even what i had complained about because i knew it was not going to be like the cosmo or wynn) and refused to do anything because they felt that that had upgraded me to a better floor even though that was the room that i had originally booked as per the photos for the specific booking. Either way even in the new room I slept ON TOP of the covers. Thank god booking did something on their end to make up for the unfortunate events. Overall not worth the money for the quality of hotel, stay anywhere else but here in Montreal.</sentence>

Old lumpy useless pillows and mattress. Old furniture from 90's. Hotel room has terrible air quality. Bathroom had stained tile grout and vent was clogged by layers of dust. I took photos to make sure I have all my colleagues avoid this place. Moldy musky smell in hallways and room. We were so disgusted by the pool. We left after just 10 minutes. The tiles were stained and dirty, layers of mildew gross rusty ladders, pool water was cloudy and looked like dirty bath water. Gym equipment did not work and was rusted. No mini fridge? Thermostat at least 30 years old and yellow?</sentence>
		<sentence>Room deal advertised showed discounted rate but in fact it is worth less given the depreciated furniture and quality. Breakfast included on advertisement when it was not. That looks like it is a false advertisement to draw people in to book. We paid $90 for breakfast ($17 per person) plus tax. Looked like a 2.5-3 star room. Updates do cost money but we work hard to pay these prices for such a substandard hotel. Parking garage is too low for an SUV. Our compact SUV car just cleared it by inches. Definitely not staying there ever again.</sentence>

		<sentence> ・ Where do I begin. To start, when we arrived to the hotel after an 8 hour drive, we were told our reservation had been cancelled because of a 'faulty credit card'. We didn't receive any kind of contact from the hotel to inform us that this had been done. We were told that the only room they had was a 1 king bed. They expected the three of us to stay in one bed. In what world?</sentence>
		<sentence>To make matters worse, the staff member who dealt with us was incredibly rude and disrespectful so much so that another staff member apologized to us when he witnessed the was the other man was speaking to us. After MUCH back and forth (at 5 a.m when we arrived, exhausted from our long drive), they finally told us they would put us in a room with a king bed and pull-out sofa for the night. When we got into our room and removed the cushions from the sofa we found a cheeto (not a joke) underneath. Needless to say we didn't feel comfortable sleeping in that pull-out bed and all of us ended up getting very little sleep in one bed together. </sentence>

We received a negligible discount off our first night which does not come close to making up for what we went through.

Mildew on the shower curtain, broken parts of sink, corners, floor, doors, curtains, rug stained, nothing dusted. I understand an old historic hotel- which this wasn't- but they can make an effort to clean well and fix damaged parts of room with care.

		<sentence> ・ We had 2 rooms for the family for two nights -rooms on the 17th floor and we did not get the bed type we requested. The rooms were extremely run down and appeared uncared for. The air exchange vent was absolutely filthy, (and we are supposed to breath in that air) the dresser was literally falling apart, the electrical sockets were so loose they couldn't be used, there was a big hole in the chair in the room, the tap was running and couldn't be turned off. There were 3 English Chanels on the tv out of the 12 total chanels that we had access to. The tv signal was dropping constantly. But, the worst part was the treatment of us by the female manager! She argued that we did get the requested bed types, she was clearly very unhappy and defensive when these issues were brought to her attention. Eventually, a miracle occurred and she was able to find a room fitting our original request on the 24th floor (whereas earlier she challenged us in our booking even though I had it on my phone and she said there were no such rooms available). We were moved to two rooms on a higher level and they were Much better.</sentence>
		<sentence>Upon arrival, the parking attendant man was extremely rude when we couldn't fit our mini van in the tiny space he directed us into. We wished we could have left upon arrival but we booked rooms that were non-refundable. </sentence>
		<sentence>Many people begging outside of hotel and you can actually watch the folks who are clearly 'on' something awful, as they pace and dance around and are present in the area. This is not the hotel's fault and security seems good at this hotel. It is located in a very centralized location. The location is however, in a very lively and bright area called Gay Village but due to things mentioned above, I wouldn't consider it the safest area in the world.</sentence>

The amount of money I have paid for the hotel rooms, I could have called Marriott directly and booked rooms myself. I have attached pics of the room to share.

The staff at the front desk was extremely helpful and very knowledgeable of places to go with children. Our room was ready on time. The view was as promised. The pool was clean and fun for the children. You had to have a room key to access the upper levels which made us feel safe.</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ I would have really liked to have a small refrigerator and microwave in the room. There was no way to keep snacks cold for the children. There were a couple bulbs blown but they came right up and replaced them. It would have been nice to have breakfast included. $60 for a family of four for a simple breakfast buffet with slimy fake eggs is quite excessive. We found Cora down the street and it was a MUCH better alternative for a family breakfast.</sentence>

Hotel staff were on strike and protesting in the front of the hotel, blasting music and whistling/blowing horns (you could hear it from the room).

Expedient action from cleaning staff to solve a problem. The bath towels were super soft and big which was very appreciated since a lot of hotel have small bath towels. Overall the room was ok. Close to St-Catherine's Street and night life (not for us but for younger groups). It connected to the Mall where you could easily access shopping, food court, and metro station. Seemed safe enough area.</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ Parking and breakfast not included in price. Arrival between 13h00 and 14h00 . Room would not be ready before 16h00. Why ask our time of arrival at reservation if room is not ready? Only room available was near the elevators which we declined. We were waiting in the lounge for our room and a couple arrived and were given their room right away is it because we had booked through an agency? I guess we looked tired of waiting because the clerk called us over after another 10 minutes and said she was giving us an upgraded room so we could go to our room and rest it was around 15h00. We went to our room which was second down from the elevator so I did not sleep the whole night. Also the hairdryer in the bathroom was so filthy that I did not dare pick it up. I saw a cleaning lady on the floor and asked her for a rag and solution to clean the air dryer. She came right over and cleaned it herself. I apologized for disturbing her work that I only needed a rag but she insisted it was her job and was happy to do it. I thanked her for her expedient solution. That was a plus. In the bathroom the necessaries were there but there was no shower cap which was a lack. Also the bath tiles were a bit moldy, the sink was cracked. It was only for one night so I did not make a fuss. If that was an upgrade I hate to see what a normal room would be like. It had the same size beds has the room I had booked plus it was 2 doors down from the elevators which I would never have accepted if I had not been so tired of waiting for our room.</sentence>

	<title>Very Poor</title>
	<text>
		<sentence> ・ The room and public areas were dirty and need renovation. There was a lot of noise. We could hear the elevators running. When we asked to change the room, we were told the hotel was fully booked, though I doubt that was really the case. We were promised earplugs, however they were never delivered to the room. Would not recommend staying here.</sentence>

	<text>
		<sentence> ・ Our room had a strong moldy smell, was dirty and run down. The mattresses sank in the middle. The female front desk staff member (I didn't catch her name) was kind and professional but the rest were terrible. One male staff kept complaining that the owner had cut staff hours so we (and others who were complaining at the front desk) should direct or complaints to the owner. Another was asked to deliver a crib to the room but he refused to do it right away because he was going on break shortly. The previously mentioned staff member (the only positive thing about the experience) had to fight to get him to deliver it. Note that this was after a combined hour of waiting for a room (late at night). Was initially sent to an occupied room at Friday. Literally opened the door and a woman walked out, who was understandably terrified that I had a key to her room. Never, ever will I stay here again. I actually called several hotels in the area but all we're booked and I was with my infant daughter. Otherwise I would have left right away.</sentence>
