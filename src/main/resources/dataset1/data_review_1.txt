Good
 · The view - although the windows need cleaning or to be changed out, as they were not clear. Location is excellent. Water pressure is also excellent.

 · Bathroom space is very small for potentially 4 people. Security should be a priority, as the hotel below ground level is connected to a small inside mall, which is a huge bonus, but - it also seems to be a converging space for the homeless, who have mental health issues and addiction issues. Makes them very in-predictable and I would not have wanted to run into one of them with small kids in tow. Saw a few having episodes the next morning.

Was more economical than other properties I searched in the area but there is room for improvement.
 · Location was close to the event we were attending. There is a parking structure attacked to the hotel so you did not need to park outside. You can travel with pets and our request for a mini fridge in the room for medication storage was honoured at no charge.

 · The bathroom was dated, some tiles were cracked in the shower and much of the grout was black. The carpet was stained but was not dirty(my socks did not turn get dirty walking on carpet). Parking garage has low ceilings(6 foot max clearance) so larger vehicles will not fit and cost is $19/day. There was a $40 charge for cleaning the room if you travel with pets that we were not told about until after check-in. The bar/restaurant was closed when we went to have a drink one evening and there are no posted hours of operation.u

Fairly good hotel, nice practical location
 · Good location, check-in/out was fast, I was able to get my room earlier than expected, and in general the stay was pleasant. It's also connected to a shopping mall and the metro system, so you don't have to go outside to get to those. It wasn't my first stay in this hotel and I'm sure it won't be my last.

 · A big space under the door let the sound and light in, which was mildly annoying while trying to sleep. I've also reduced the score for "Facilities" because the hotel still follows the archaic (and slightly offensive) practice of putting a Bible (or, in this case, New Testament) in the room. As a Non-Christian, this irritates me and I would like it to stop.

A perfect location to enjoy Montreal, if you don't mind a hotel way beyond its remodeling date.
 · Location; Adjacent underground car parking; Next to the Metro;

 · The hotel is showing its age. Everything needs to be upgraded. Difficult for staff to keep clean under the circumstances. Bathrooms particularly looking old and seedy - caulking mouldy. However, the price is less than half tht of the modern hotels in downtown Montreal, so it is still good value for money. Just don't look too deeply.

 · A lot of homeless people in the area and drug use, the pool only being open 6-10, rooms could use updating, more plug ins near the bed would be nice, some plug ins didn’t work. Your website also isn’t updated - our room had a fridge but that wasn’t expected so it would have been nice to know and the shower was nicer then what the picture showed and that might attract more people. The man that ushered people into the elevators when it was busy was extremely rude and pushy

Also in the rooms the vents were filled with black dust/ dustballs. Deep cleaning must be done in the room. Also the number of toiletries must reasonably reflect the number of guests in the room.

good location, shame about the pool !!
 · The hotel is in a good location and the rooms were quite plush. We had a room on the 18th floor which gave us a good view of the city.

 · I couldn't believe that the swimming pool in a 4 star esablishment didn't open during weekdays till 6.00pm.
there is nothing i like better on holiday than going for an early morning swim and was disappointed that this option was not available to me.
Also the front desk seemd to be slow in checking visitors into the hotel

Reasonably priced hotel in great location. With some updates could be great. Would stay again.
 · Staff friendly and helpful, easy check in. On site underground covered parking with in/out access was a plus for downtown. The hotel location itself can't be beat for the price too, it's close to Berri-Uqam Metro, there is a food court in the building and a grocery store. You're also real close to the Village, Ste Denis and other streets of interest within walking distance too.

 · Furniture in the rooms a little run down, bathroom too could do with a good scrubbing, but nothing horrific. 
For a none smoking hotel there were guests smoking in rooms, the smell came through the vents on the last night of our stay. A quick call to the frontdesk and they were very apologetic and said they would look in to it.

Overall pleasant
 · The view was incredible!!! The bed was comfortable and the room size was decent. The price matched the star rating.

 · The biggest con for me was the pool hours. On the website it indicated 8am to noon and 6pm to 10pm (subject to change) so seeing that, we decided to call to make sure these were the correct hours which the receptionist agreed they were. Arriving that night, we see that the pool is no longer open in the morning. If we had known that prior to booking we probably wouldn’t have stayed there because we were really looking forward to our morning swim. 
I also think pet friendly hotels are great for all dog owners but, not if they have carpeting, I don’t think it’s appropriate flooring, it had a slight dog scent and my allergies acted up a little. I’m assuming that limits the clientel and will discourage non pet owners or whoever that isn’t bringing a pet along, to book there. But it wasn’t overly disgusting which to me means the cleaning is well done. Also the bathroom walls were kind of gross by where the garbage was under the sink, looked like someone was sick and left a dried up souvenir. 
Customer service wasn’t overly friendly when checking-in but I’ve had worse.

 · both pool & exercise room were shut down during our visit, which was one of the reasons we chose the hotel so were very disappointed to find out only upon check-in (though we were upgraded to a room with a better view). As well, I asked in my booking if there was a charge for our dog, which I specified we were bringing. Not only did we not hear back that there was a charge, it was only upon check-in that we were informed it was $30 extra for the dog. Management waived the $20 parking fee to compensate for this but overall, just not great communication from management.

The car park in this hotel was the most challenge thing in our entire trip in Canada, not just narrow but the ceiling height was just 1.7m so if you drive taller car you better think twice. We were driving the Dodge Grand Caravan consider not a very tall car but we have so much trouble to get in and out the car park.

Great location close to the subway and main arteries but too expensive.
 · The daily parking pass allowed us to come in and out easily (extra daily costs). The attendant in the parking garage were helpful with directions.

 · The "queen size:" bed, probably a double bed, was too small and not very comfortable.
The pool was smelling chlorine so bad that they have to leave the door open to vent the smell.
Who wants to swim in diluted Javex when bromine is available nowadays. 
No Jacuzzi available to relax tired legs at the end of the day.
The sauna was not working for women and they were told to walk through the men's dressing room and showers to access their sauna!
Every day we had to ask for supplies that the maids forgot to replenish. After a while it got annoying especially when you return to the room later at nigh.
We had to pay $20+ extra to have a fridge in the room although we were paying more than $250 a day.

Good location.
 · Close to everything

 · When I can with my kids it's was a gay activity in the hotel and I felt can of uncountable ' cause I was with my kids and some guest from back home. The first impression when we get in to THE hotel was a lot of guys and girls dressing like porn movie and offering their service. So it was kind of shocking for me and emburisin in front of me children and sister from back home.

location good, but frustration over parking.
 · location

 · parking. If we had a car it would have been better but we drive a truck. When checking in they didn't ask us what vehicle we drove and told us to park underground in the public parking next door. Our truck didn't fit . so we spent money on a meter outside. We were then directed by the hotel to another underground parking 2 blocks away. Not happy. It could have saved us about an hour if they asked us at check in what kind of vehicle we drove and directed us there immediately. They wouldn't even budge on price. I asked for 10.00 off for our parking (meter plugged for that) because it was their error in not mentioning that trucks don't fit. and I found them unfriendly in this manner. That bad hospitality left a bad impression on me and I woulnt go back.

Great location. Hotel itself was decent, but nothing spectacular for what we paid.
 · The location was incredible. We were within walking distance to everything we wanted to see, and right beside the Gay District. Lots of lovely patios, cafes and restaurants. The location was the best part of the hotel.

 · I tried to get information before I arrived at the hotel and no one was helpful. I didn't find the service the greatest re communication. We then ran into an issue upon check-in and were forced to wait while the staff tried to figure it out...even though we were tired from travelling for 10 hours and hadn't eaten a real meal in over 24 hours. That was a little frustrating.

I love the city of Montreal enough to make the most of my stay, but I would not stay there again!
 · I like the location of this hotel for its proximity to the gay village village, Old Montreal and Chinatown. I also like the fact the the bank is conveniently located right next to it. The stores in Place Dupuis, especially the IGA supermarket and the pharmacy are superb, and I like the fact that I could go right into the mall without going outside the hotel.

 · This hotel is rather overpriced for a place with no fridge, no microwave, and no room safe for valuables. It would have been so nice to keep some cold beverages in my room and some snacks in the fridge. With that wonderful market there and so many good restaurants, I would also have been able to store leftovers in my room for later or the next day instead of having to waste so much food and spend so much on fresh meals everyday.
The pillows on the bed gave me a severe neck and shoulder pain which ruined my stay. They should be replaced with foam pillows or the hotel should at least be able to supply foam pillows for those who request them.
I also did not like the idea that they added a $300 deposit to my credit card at check in which took several weeks to drop off my card. Are they having that much of a problem with people stealing things or messing up the rooms? 
I think it's high time the hotel along with the bank should urge the city of Montreal to do something about all the panhandling right outside the hotel. You can't step outside anytime day or night without street people jumping in your face for change.
I do not think I would stay there again unless there was no other option available.

superb location, decent outdated hotel
 · The location and the the view from upper floors facing the city were superb.

 · Hotel hasn't been upgraded in 10+ years; furniture in the room was old, carpets were circa 1980's.
The room was clean, albeit smallish.
This hotel needs major renovation and upgrade to the 21st century

The view from the dinning room is interesting (the gay village) and the staff is helpful and very kind. Convenient parking and all the facilities around in the shopping center in which the hotel is located. The hotel is also beside the subway, which is very convenient when you do not want to take your car.

 · No frig in the room (unless you pay an extra 25$ for your stay; and this only if there is availability). No safety box, which makes your life more complicated. There is a bath but the whole restroom is a little small and needs some refreshment. Long check-out. All in all, this hotel is a little bit too expensive for what is offered.

 · Very comfortable mattress. Great location to enjoy all Montreal has to offer. Was super cool watching the show in the Jardins Gamelin happening below us. Loved the convenient access to metro, grocery store, wine and beer store and food court etc...The breakfast buffet had a nice variety. Check in and check out were hassle free and all needs were met by the staff when we had requests and overall a trouble free stay.

 · Didn't appreciate having to pay for parking, it wasn't cheap either. I think we should have been offered a special rate since the parking garage was open to the public, however the parking spots available were conveniently located. The room was very dated which was disappointing considering it wasn't cheaply priced and it was located in the heart of the city on the upper floors and it was advertised as a deluxe room. Plus we had to pay extra to have a mini fridge. The room initially wasn't cleaned to my satisfaction as I found stray hairs around in the bathroom and the carpet could have been cleaned more thoroughly. So for the price, it could have been better in my opinion.

Within walking distance to the Festival area (around Place des Arts), the main shopping area, the Old City, the Old Harbour. Friendly staff. Clean. The views of Montreal from the room, especially at night, are amazing.

 · Outdated elevators that kept failing. Out of the four elevators, at times only one would not be out of order. Long wait at busy times, especially since this hotel appears very popular with tour buses and flight crews. Once during the stay, we were stuck for 15 minutes on the 28th floor because all the elevators were offline. Looks like the elevators just randomly kept going online and offline with 1 to 4 elevators randomly available. That was a major annoyance. Mold on the ceiling over the shower in my business room.

 · While the hotel is slightly dated, it was clean and comfortable and an incredible bargain for the location which was very close to many things my family tried to do. The towels were huge. Even though we booked on line, we were offered a choice of rooms and we selected a great view from the 25th floor. When walking about the city it is easy to see and use the tall hotel as a landmark. We were there for the first night of the Jazz festival and we were surprised to even get a room on short notice. I did not get an opportunity to check out the pool or exercise area, nor did we go to the bar or restaurant as we spent as much time as possible in the city.

 · We had to pay parking and then were heavily charged when we left after 6 to let the rush hour traffic go by. I'm sure this would be true of other area hotels though. 
A mini fridge and microwave would have been nice, our room had none.

Great hotel for a weekend in Montreal
 · The staff was very nice and accommodating. We got there an hour early and were able to check in right away. Everything was close: grocery stores, pharmacies, food, 10-15 minute walk from Old Montreal.

 · Our room was prepared for 2 guests even though the reservation was for 4. We had to ask for additional towels, coffee, and cups. After a 7 hour drive it would have been nice to not have to worry about that.

Wish I had stayed elsewhere
 · Beds were comfortable and the WiFi worked well. There is a supermarket attached to the hotel which is very convenient.

 · Overall the rooms and halls felt grungy and outdated. I was on the 12th floor and a friend on a higher floor had a different experience though we paid comparable rates. (See photo to highlight the laughable aesthetic differences between the two floors when you get off the elevator.) There was no mini-fridge in the room. The bathroom was dark and it had a rusty sink and stained ceilings. The lightbulb in the lamp next to my bed was burned out. Check-in is strictly at 4pm and there is a charge if you want an earlier time. Aside from the man who stored our luggage upon arrival, the staff was not friendly or accommodating. There is a park across the street with a lot of homeless people who beg as you enter and exit the hotel. There are a few cute bars and restaurants in the immediate area but it's still a bit of walk or taxi ride to get to the main tourist areas.

The worst.
 · It was one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in, starting from the confusing parking structure/elevator to the hotel ( that are not easy to navigate or properly labeled). The check-in was one of the longest I've ever had to go through. For some reason there was only one baggage cart. The room was out of date and needs to have basic repair, like the door to the bathroom did not close properly without trapping you inside. The fixtures leaked and tiles were cracked and coming out and it was moldy and dirty. The tv randomly raised in volume and wouldn't turn off without shutting off power to the entire room. The rooms were not super clean, there was mold in the bathroom, no coffee in the maker ( and it was dirty) there was even a swastika etched in the wood next to the toilet ( something that could easily been covered or removed). The area around the hotel was not the greatest and you had to walk a bit too get to all the 'tourist' spots; and I wouldn't call the area you had to walk at night super safe. The area could be loud especially if you have a room with a view. Not sure how they were rated 4 stars, but they are barely above a motel.

 · Literally everything. They need a top to bottom remodel and New management. Something's could be changed with no money just with staff attention. The hotel is a 1 star hotel.

Not my best experience and would not recommend this place
 · This hotel was not what I expected for a four star hotel. 
The staff at the reception were not very friendly when I approached them for check in. They were quite blunt and unresponsive to my inquiries, but we're very charismatic when responding to the guest after me who spoke French. 
The pictures in the postings were not very accurate. The rooms are quite old and out dated, the washroom is extremely tiny and very loud fan. The lighting was dim, and the air conditioning in my room did not work. 
There is no sound proof at all, my room was on the 12th floor and I could hear the pounding music from the streets outside at 8am in the morning 
There is parking available that charges 30 dollars a day but it's underground so only okay for small cars.
The hotel is located right next to a subway station which would be convenient for travelers without a car.

Also the coffee machine was difficult to work and it was often/impossible to find the concierge. Other people complained to us about him.

The air conditioning and wifi didn’t work the best. Had to go to Starbucks to send emails for work.
My last night here I asked if we could get toilet paper - they said they didn’t have any and gave me a box of Kleenex..

 · Breakfast at the hotel restaurant too expensive
Most family cannot afford 18.95 per person for breakfast it's the beginning for the expenses
Heard many negative comment about the type of breakfast, taste and price
Definitely should have a small shuddle bus to bring client to the old port and back price maybe 5.00$ each person 
Schedule in the morning, afternoon and evenings 
(Example; bus leaves hotel 10;am and pick up 12;30 and at the same time more people from the hotel to old port 
Etc maybe one last pick up 21;30 or so

 · I had a bad feeling about this the moment I entered the hotel. But I got to the front desk the lady was on the phone chatting with some friends laughing giggling definitely not paying attention to the fact that I was standing in front of part ready to check in. It was past my check in time so I am actually paying for the room while she is busy social dancing around on the phone. After giving her a few looks she finally hangs up the phone she checked me in. I had requested the room with a view but I was refused. I had also requested a microwave for the baby that was also rejected. It was apparently supposed to be a non-smoking hotel, however the room had strong smoke smell as if someone had just finished smoking. He entered the room with our six month old baby. I called and held the line for over 15 minutes before I was asked to come down and she would check me in another room. Apparently it was on the same floor as our previous room but she would not send someone upstairs with a different set of keys and let us into another room. I had to drag my child along with all my bags in order to get a different group. I did not appreciate that. It was a horrible experience I suggest you heed my words and don’t stay at this hotel so you don’t have to experience what I did for $200. I had to pay for the parking and the Wi-Fi because the free Internet was extremely slow

There are 3 lamps in the room 2 were literally broken,and completely un useable. Wallpaper was starting to lift in a number of areas. The lamp shades on the wall lamps in the hall ways were crooked. Easy fix by staff just caring! There was so much dust and filth in the bathroom vent it was stomach turning. The area of the city this hotel is located in is fun and easy to have a good time. Great restaurants and stuff to do in walking distance. MAJOR bummer of a hotel... it needs to be rehabbed and updated badly. I wish I had taken photos!

Very disappointed with this hotel! The overall review score does not reflect my experience at all.
 · The beds were comfortable and they have nice big towels.

 · The room looked dirty; the wallpaper was peeling and there was mould behind it and along the wall. There were stains on the wall and on the sheets. The bathroom was mouldy (especially the ceiling), smelly and dark. There were empty electrical sockets in several places in the room and it smelled. They had us in the wrong room first (we asked for 2 beds and has 1 king bed instead) so we actually got to see 2 rooms on 2 different floors. They were both the same. I thought I had booked a Superior Room with 2 double beds and I don't feel like this room was superior at all. I spend a lot of time in hotels (I travel a lot for work) and this was my worst hotel room experience by far. This is not an inexpensive hotel either.

 · Nothing. The smell of smoke was coming through the ventilation. The front desk didn’t offer to do anything about it other than look into it and then stated it was, “just the smell of the vents.” Gross. The whole place needs a Reno. Also, pool was closed on Sunday because they put too much chlorine in. Not exactly pro staff running the show. Next time I’ll stay at the Marriott.

Never again.

Our first room was filthy, empty alcohol bottles my 7yr son found, the wall had cigarettes butted out on It, bathroom had body hair in the bathtub and sink area. I complained and they told me they would send someone up to look??? 10 mins later they asked me to come down to change rooms.... 2nd one wasn't any better but I figured I'd tough it out the 2 nights rather than argue with them. I travel to Montreal regularly and will definitely avoid this hotel.

I liked the location, but the the temperature in the room made it difficult to enjoy the stay
 · The breakfast buffet was good but a bit pricy for a 9 year old. My other child was 6, but if she had been 7, I would have not eaten at the buffet in order not to pay 9$ for her to eat at the buffet.
Kids enjoyed the free wi-fi in the room.
The kids enjoyed the pool.
I enjoyed having The Journal de Montréal every morning at no extra cost and without an incentive of reducing the cost of my room if I do not take a copy. I hate when hotels do that.
It was close to everything, including a small shopping mall within the complex.

 · we had to move room because the room was hot, not warm. hot!!! We were told because of the change of season, it had been difficult to adjust temperature. We moved 3 floors down and it was a bit better because we could open a small window, but it was still warm and not was not very enjoyable. Thank god, we were only there for 2 days. Never had any issues elsewhere because of change of season in other hotels. Poor excuse. Invest!!!
Expensive.
The pool hours were too limited. It should be opened 24 hours a day or at least from 6am and all day until 22pm.

 · Best location, accessible to everything as Well as to all downtown, best panoramic view from large room window to downtown and to Mont-Royal Hill, best comfortable beds, very clean suite, best towels, excellent welcome reception service, having easy access to multi food court and other shopping facilities (IGA grocery store) on the ground floor connected to the metro / subway...Despite paying your own breakfast meal (not included), it was very rich meals and quasi delicious... You really feel the top luxurious ambiance. I will come back again to this Hotel for sure eevrytime I will be visiting ma Belle Ville Montréal..

 · The only thing I'd like if the Hotel management can include the breakfast with the room hotel rate/fees.

Stay some place else
 · This hotel is listed as a 4 star I think the people at booking should stay there an then tell it’s star the room did have a nice view of a bridge that light up in different colours.

 · We arrived our room was ready but for a fee the guy at the desk must of been having a bad day not very pleasant we decided to leave our bags with the service desk. Thou I do want to say staying at many 4&5 star hotels when checking in on a Sunday if the room was ready we have always been given the room upon arrival just saying. Around 4:30 that afternoon and given our room the bathtub tiles had a black mole on the grout the sink leaked the amount of visible dust on vents in bathroom and the room was disgusting the room itself was very very lived in the black out drapes have holes in them etc etc etc the area of this hotel was full of very aggressive homeless people and drugged out people a warning to family’s not the best part of the city it was overwhelming what we say and experienced we were shocked at what goes on around the area of this hotel . I will not be staying at this hotel again nor will I recommend it to anyone

 · This hotel was exemplary during our stay. Staff were very friendly, responded immediately, professional. The room was spacious, very clean, beautiful view of a beautiful city. Access to the mall was a huge bonus, especially IGA's wonderful selection of foods and beverages. 
The only challenge is that there are many missions in the neighbourhood, with an array of homeless persons trying to make their way in life. Never-the-less, we felt safe at all times. We even had evening meals outside, which is incredible for Montreal in late October!!
Going forward, we will stay at this property with eagerness, and will recommend it highly to our friends and family!
The walking proximity to Old Montreal, the harbour, the Bascilica, was perfect for an inner city walking vacation.

 · NOTHING.DO NOT BOOK HERE!!!

 · DISGUSTING. WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED AT. This hotel states that it is a 4 star, in my opinion that is a lie. The room that I got was what i imagine a motel would be.Dirty, smelly, rude staff, photos do not match the actual hotel. The photos are from what i could tell that was the one renovated floors that the hotel has (which is classified as business) and apparently is an extra charge even though the photos for the regular double queen room has those photos. The original room I was given had live flies, cob webs, dust in the air, dust surrounding the vents etc, rotting doors, and holes in the walls . Checking in a 12 am I was extra upset. I lasted an hour in the room before i called and asked if there was another room... they then moved me to the business class room . Once i got that room, as soon as i walked into the room it was renovated BUT it was still smelly and dirty, there was a fruit pit on the floor as soon as i walked beside the bed. Called booking and basically the hotel lied to booking about what i had said and the stated that their hotel was only outdated (which was not even what i had complained about because i knew it was not going to be like the cosmo or wynn) and refused to do anything because they felt that that had upgraded me to a better floor even though that was the room that i had originally booked as per the photos for the specific booking. Either way even in the new room I slept ON TOP of the covers. Thank god booking did something on their end to make up for the unfortunate events. Overall not worth the money for the quality of hotel, stay anywhere else but here in Montreal.

If I was a crack addict I would definitely come here to party.
 · The metro grocery store was conveniently located within the hotel.

 · The room was in dire need of maintenance. The room felt like it had previously accommodated drugs and prostitution. I went out at around 10 pm to find a taste of Montreal to witness drug dealers and addicts in close proximity. It became apparent that this was not in a good place for children. The pool area felt dirty the gym was run down and out dated. Seems like it may have had a touch of class at one point but was severely neglected over the years as the mood and times have changed in the area. Depressing

Very Disappointing
 · Location was good for getting around to the venues we wanted to visit and beds were comfy

 · This hotel needs a serious upgrading on its rooms, They are overcharging for what you get for its star rating, mildew in the shower tile, carpets felt damp and stains in the hallway, towel holder fell of the wall, toilets and tub needed more cleaning attention.
Had a problem with checking in, Fionnia and the On Duty Supervisor Gustavo made the check-in process insulting & annoying. We had booked on line and I had listed my wife as a guest with payment on MY credit card, but they said they needed her ID for us to check in not mine, unfortunately she left her ID at home and so we got challenged and lectured about who we were for this reservation, 
Considering how this was prepaid on my credit card with my name on it
Its to bad but I would never recommend or stay again at a Gouverneur Hotel anywhere

Majorly Disappointed
 · Downtown location close to metro

 · Outdated decor. Old,peeling wall paper,water damaged vanity and ceilings, dirty furniture, carpets stained, chair upholstery stains galore, even lighting scones had rust. Old lumpy useless pillows and mattress. Old furniture from 90's. Hotel room has terrible air quality. Bathroom had stained tile grout and vent was clogged by layers of dust. I took photos to make sure I have all my colleagues avoid this place. Moldy musky smell in hallways and room. We were so disgusted by the pool. We left after just 10 minutes. The tiles were stained and dirty, layers of mildew gross rusty ladders, pool water was cloudy and looked like dirty bath water. Gym equipment did not work and was rusted. No mini fridge? Thermostat at least 30 years old and yellow?
Room deal advertised showed discounted rate but in fact it is worth less given the depreciated furniture and quality. Breakfast included on advertisement when it was not. That looks like it is a false advertisement to draw people in to book. We paid $90 for breakfast ($17 per person) plus tax. Looked like a 2.5-3 star room. Updates do cost money but we work hard to pay these prices for such a substandard hotel. Parking garage is too low for an SUV. Our compact SUV car just cleared it by inches. Definitely not staying there ever again.

 · Not a lot. Location is OK

 · We stayed for over a week for work and I don't have many positives to say about the hotel. We paid extra for a better room and as soon as we arrived it was a let down. The check in was painfully slow with only 1 person on the desk. The room was dirty and very dated. I have been charged more than I was originally quoted and I have asked for a full receipt but they have not replied to my emails, just taken the money they wanted.
I booked a taxi through the concierge but he didn't do it as promised and instead used a dodgy taxi to get my partner to the airport as she left before myself who forced her to pay cash for the ride and not card. I'd stay elsewhere.

Really negative experience
 · The second room we got was clean and the bed was comfortable. The washroom was tiny, the size of a small closet.

 · Where do I begin. To start, when we arrived to the hotel after an 8 hour drive, we were told our reservation had been cancelled because of a 'faulty credit card'. We didn't receive any kind of contact from the hotel to inform us that this had been done. We were told that the only room they had was a 1 king bed. They expected the three of us to stay in one bed. In what world?
To make matters worse, the staff member who dealt with us was incredibly rude and disrespectful so much so that another staff member apologized to us when he witnessed the was the other man was speaking to us. After MUCH back and forth (at 5 a.m when we arrived, exhausted from our long drive), they finally told us they would put us in a room with a king bed and pull-out sofa for the night. When we got into our room and removed the cushions from the sofa we found a cheeto (not a joke) underneath. Needless to say we didn't feel comfortable sleeping in that pull-out bed and all of us ended up getting very little sleep in one bed together. 
The management staff didn't seem too concerned with our negative experience. We received a negligible discount off our first night which does not come close to making up for what we went through. We won't be returning to this hotel and we definitely won't be recommending it to our family and friends. Not only was it overpriced for what you are getting (an outdated 3 star at most) but the staff don't bother to ensue you are satisfied with your stay.

Convenient to Metro and Gay Village
 · Room was very comfortable! There were issues with the elevators a couple of days (you really can only have 8 people per car or the elevators have issues!). The buffet breakfast was excellent. 
The property is so convenient and easy to reach via subway (Metro). I will be back!

 · We had a couple of issues with housekeeping not being able to understand when I would be out of the room for cleaning. Other than that, a completely wonderful stay! Oh yes: the elevators had issues with being out of order.

The location was great for me, just a short walk or drive to all of the neighborhoods. I mostly walked places and only used my car a couple times. My room on the 21st floor had a great view of the city. I didn't use the pool or fitness center, but enjoyed the free wifi.

Mildew on the shower curtain, broken parts of sink, corners, floor, doors, curtains, rug stained, nothing dusted. I understand an old historic hotel- which this wasn't- but they can make an effort to clean well and fix damaged parts of room with care.

The wifi is free which is appreciable. The car parking costs 21$ per day which is a little expensive but the hotel is in the city center so you don't have to look after spots.

 · Great location with food court and subway in bottom of the hotel. We had a gorgeous view of the city. Great buffet breakfast. 3 really great staff members (2 men working at front desk and David, the concierge)

 · We had 2 rooms for the family for two nights -rooms on the 17th floor and we did not get the bed type we requested. The rooms were extremely run down and appeared uncared for. The air exchange vent was absolutely filthy, (and we are supposed to breath in that air) the dresser was literally falling apart, the electrical sockets were so loose they couldn't be used, there was a big hole in the chair in the room, the tap was running and couldn't be turned off. There were 3 English Chanels on the tv out of the 12 total chanels that we had access to. The tv signal was dropping constantly. But, the worst part was the treatment of us by the female manager! She argued that we did get the requested bed types, she was clearly very unhappy and defensive when these issues were brought to her attention. Eventually, a miracle occurred and she was able to find a room fitting our original request on the 24th floor (whereas earlier she challenged us in our booking even though I had it on my phone and she said there were no such rooms available). We were moved to two rooms on a higher level and they were Much better.
Upon arrival, the parking attendant man was extremely rude when we couldn't fit our mini van in the tiny space he directed us into. We wished we could have left upon arrival but we booked rooms that were non-refundable. 
Many people begging outside of hotel and you can actually watch the folks who are clearly 'on' something awful, as they pace and dance around and are present in the area. This is not the hotel's fault and security seems good at this hotel. It is located in a very centralized location. The location is however, in a very lively and bright area called Gay Village but due to things mentioned above, I wouldn't consider it the safest area in the world.

Fantastic Location Super Value and Accomodation
 · The bed was super comfy. The shower was strong and hot. The view from the room spectacular. The mall and metro are accessible via the lobby. You could not ask for a better location. Walked to old town and the old port. The Village is adjacent. Stay on a business floor for maximum value. Room 2602 was lovely!

 · Nothing

 · The rooms were dirty as hell and they are out dated. I am very disappointed with the service I received from booking.com - deceiving photos, etc and the service from the hotel staff. We moved twice to a different room, and every room was a disaster. They have asked us to move to 25th floor from 16th, and by then we were very tired of explaining and running around. The amount of money I have paid for the hotel rooms, I could have called Marriott directly and booked rooms myself. I have attached pics of the room to share. I demand that I should be compensated 50% of what I have paid for these rooms.

Staff strike | impacts guests | not advised at check in
 · Easy to get to and from Le Village. There is a great IGA (supermarket) right next door and the metro is located immediately below the hotel, making connection to Via Rail easy.

 · Housekeeping staff were on strike re a pay dispute. No reduction in tariff was offered and when asked I was referred to Head Office. Our travel party was not informed at check in and the first we knew was a note slipped under the door on or first night. As a result, a basic service was offered only which included replacing towels and toiletries. No room service, dining, etc.

Small Spring Break Get-A-Way
 · I emailed in advance due to word of the employees striking at the hotel. I was reassured that all securities and most accommodations were still in place. The staff at the front desk was extremely helpful and very knowledgeable of places to go with children. Our room was ready on time. The view was as promised. The pool was clean and fun for the children. You had to have a room key to access the upper levels which made us feel safe.

 · I would have really liked to have a small refrigerator and microwave in the room. There was no way to keep snacks cold for the children. There were a couple bulbs blown but they came right up and replaced them. It would have been nice to have breakfast included. $60 for a family of four for a simple breakfast buffet with slimy fake eggs is quite excessive. We found Cora down the street and it was a MUCH better alternative for a family breakfast.

Hotel staff were on strike and protesting in the front of the hotel, blasting music and whistling/blowing horns (you could hear it from the room).

And way over priced for a two night stay where you got no service what so ever you would think they would offer you a discount at the fact that we stayed there during a strike and not having any assistance the entire weekend.

Good hotel with a few minuses
 · Close to downtown & Cavalia. Staff at reception was friendly,polite and helpful with information. Room was clean (bathroom see other comments below). Staff was helpful with questions. Expedient action from cleaning staff to solve a problem. The bath towels were super soft and big which was very appreciated since a lot of hotel have small bath towels. Overall the room was ok. Close to St-Catherine's Street and night life (not for us but for younger groups). It connected to the Mall where you could easily access shopping, food court, and metro station. Seemed safe enough area.

 · Parking and breakfast not included in price. Arrival between 13h00 and 14h00 . Room would not be ready before 16h00. Why ask our time of arrival at reservation if room is not ready? Only room available was near the elevators which we declined. We were waiting in the lounge for our room and a couple arrived and were given their room right away is it because we had booked through an agency? I guess we looked tired of waiting because the clerk called us over after another 10 minutes and said she was giving us an upgraded room so we could go to our room and rest it was around 15h00. We went to our room which was second down from the elevator so I did not sleep the whole night. Also the hairdryer in the bathroom was so filthy that I did not dare pick it up. I saw a cleaning lady on the floor and asked her for a rag and solution to clean the air dryer. She came right over and cleaned it herself. I apologized for disturbing her work that I only needed a rag but she insisted it was her job and was happy to do it. I thanked her for her expedient solution. That was a plus. In the bathroom the necessaries were there but there was no shower cap which was a lack. Also the bath tiles were a bit moldy, the sink was cracked. It was only for one night so I did not make a fuss. If that was an upgrade I hate to see what a normal room would be like. It had the same size beds has the room I had booked plus it was 2 doors down from the elevators which I would never have accepted if I had not been so tired of waiting for our room.

Great location with mediocre accommodations.
 · The location was amazing. It was in the center of everything and within walking distance of anything you would need or want. The lobby was also very beautiful

 · The furnishings were not as pictured. They were severely outdated. While the linens were clean, the dust ruffles and furniture fabric was stained and looked dirty.

 · Great location right beside Berri-UQAM. Rue Ste-Catherine was a very fun street to walk around. Lots of food in the area. Big room with plenty of space. Comfy bed and an incredible view. Sauna was a nice surprise.

 · Very expensive for what it was. It was a great hotel but still felt about $50 too expensive for what it was. The internet was also spotty at best. Front desk staff were not very helpful with some things.

The main lobby is very elegant. 
This hotel is next to the central Metro station, which was very convenient.

 · The room has some minor areas that could use some updating. The secondary lock on the door was coming loose, and the wall stub for the door had fallen off. Some of the tiles in the bathroom need to be re-grouted as well as other areas of the bathroom that should be updated.

Good value for the money for a quick weekend stay. Helpful staff, clean rooms.
 · The room was clean as well as the bedding and it was very comfortable. We were able to get extra towels. Staff was helpful.

 · Room service would have been nice. When we were coming back from a fun dinner with friends at the end of the night. There were some skeptical looking guests that looked like trouble. Security would nice to have especially near the elevators. We did not take the elevators with those guests and waited for another.

Great location but my room sucked
 · The location was great. It was close to restaurants, metro station and attractions.

 · My room was pretty bad. Torn drapes, peeling wall paper, caked on dust on the light fixtures and other parts of the room. I really didn't spend much time in the room plus the bed was comfortable and I had hot water so I didn't complain to management.

 · Our room had a strong moldy smell, was dirty and run down. The mattresses sank in the middle. The female front desk staff member (I didn't catch her name) was kind and professional but the rest were terrible. One male staff kept complaining that the owner had cut staff hours so we (and others who were complaining at the front desk) should direct or complaints to the owner. Another was asked to deliver a crib to the room but he refused to do it right away because he was going on break shortly. The previously mentioned staff member (the only positive thing about the experience) had to fight to get him to deliver it. Note that this was after a combined hour of waiting for a room (late at night). Was initially sent to an occupied room at Friday. Literally opened the door and a woman walked out, who was understandably terrified that I had a key to her room. Never, ever will I stay here again. I actually called several hotels in the area but all we're booked and I was with my infant daughter. Otherwise I would have left right away.
