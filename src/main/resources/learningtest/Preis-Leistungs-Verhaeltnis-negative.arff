28406,'It turned out they had a problem with their toilet but , unbelievably for a hotel of this size , there was no maintenance personnel on site to sort the problem . ',false
28407,'As the hotel was fully booked our only option was to move to another hotel for the night . ',false
28408,'We did nt even know where this new hotel was ! ',false
28409,'Because we wanted to be in Alexanderplatz , the next morning we moved back to the Radisson , where the receptionist was very apologetic and offered us free breakfasts to compensate us . ',false
