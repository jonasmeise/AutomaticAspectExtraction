Very good stay
 · Location excellent, very close to the central train station, and lively spot right in big central square in city, but room was up high at other side of hotel, so noise not a problem (ask for quiet room)
Good facilities, though bathroom layout is a little odd, bed comfortable. Room too hot, and aircon didn't seem to work that well, hard to say how hot room would've been without it.

 · On one occasion the staff at reception were a little rude but mostly very helpful.

Good stay with excellent location, however not an excellent value for money.
 · Great location, clean rooms, cozy bed, nice view, good WiFi, nice staff.

 · Overall:
Smaller rooms than expected.
No refrigerator (mini bar) in the room.
Missing water heater (tea heater).
Safety deposit box in our room wasn't working. 
Dirty windows on the outside of the building.
Visiting the roof terrace could be free for the guests of the hotel.
The bathroom:
The bathroom with just a curtain and without the door isn't practical, because of the stem going into the room.
The marble floor was really cold, because there wasn't any floor heating.
The glass door on the bath is too small, therefor the water is splashing all over the bathroom floor.

Great Hotel in the center of Berlin !!!!
 · The location of the Hotel is one of the best in the city, Metro station is very closed and all shopping mall e.g. Alexa, Kaufhof are just few minutes away. The room is not so big but well equipped and very good structured where you can find all your needs. Refrigerator is also there and a lot of snacks are also available in the room.

 · The internet connection could be much more better for a four stars hotel in the center of the city and I hope the management of the hotel take this comment seriously and improve the connection as it was not only my comment but many travelers have already include it in their reviews. In addition the room temperature is quite higher than usual so therefore I opened the window the whole time in order to adjust the temperature.

Good hotel overall, room needs improvements
 · Perfect location in the heart of Alexanderplatz and close to S-Bahn and U-hahn trains. Very helpful staff, easy to check in/out. Bathroom is exposed to room which me and my partner enjoyed. Room temperature regulated well.

 · Rock solid beds with thin pillows, double bed is 2 singles pushed together and has 2 since duvets. Shower temperature controlled in separate toilet so showering was a 2 man job, shower drainage terrible- overflowed within 5 mins of water running. If you like having your own space this room doesn't have that as bathroom is completely exposed and toilet is only behind very lightly frosted glass. Very invasive cleaning staff banging the door between 9.30-11am consistently every day.

Great location, a few things let it down
 · The location is perfect, you’re right next to an underground and seconds away from a bus and tram stop, the hotel is huge so you can spot it a mile away. Perfect hotel for Christmas markets, one is on the doorstep another is a 5 minutes walk.

 · We arrived around 1pm straight from the airport knowing check in was at 3 but it’s always worth checking, we got quite a hostile response saying no check in as 3 your room is not ready, which we understood so we then asked if we could leave our luggage. We were told yes you can do this in our luggage room which we walked over to and we’re shocked to find there was a €2 charge per bag, so we didn’t leave the bags out of principle, we’re paying over €500 and we can’t even leave our bags free of charge. Upon arrival to our room we were amazed by the view I had upgraded to a panorama room which for the view was worth it. I was disappointed to find no tea making facilities in the room only a coffee capsule machine, one very thin wardrobe and NO drawers which I found very strange and no iron. We also could not get the heating to turn down so had all windows open which the maid kept closing, now we were there 15-19th December and most days it was 0 degrees but this heating was unbearable and whatever the staff told us to do didn’t work. On our final morning, I was woken by a member of the housekeeping team walking into the room at 8:30 when check out is at 12pm, I found this very disappointing, we wanted to sleep in ready for our flight home but weren’t able to due to this incident. It is also €4 for a small bottle of water in the hotel reception so I would advise buying these from a supermarket. I would recommend this hotel for location and view but not really anything else you could get just as good rooms and service for a lot lower in cost.

Very large hotel in a good location, good value for city hotel
 · Breakfast was reasonable. The hotel bar Spagos was very comfortable and had a good atmosphere for a hotel bar with nightly entertainment. The hotel was very well located and local transport was minutes was away.

 · The scrambled egg was tasteless and I felt the breakfast was a bit like a conveyor belt with a big queue for the hot breakfast buffet. The hotel could have easily had added another buffet to reduce the queue. The room was on the small size and I was disapoointed that there was no mini bar or tea/coffee facilities in the room. Also water leaked out from the 'special rain effect shower' , but shower was quite powerful. Also I was dissappointed that there was no body lotion supplied which is the norm for a 4star hotel. The pillows were very poor, we rang reception for 2 pillows which were sent up immediately - but the pillows were so thin we could have done with a 3rd pillow. Roof terrace bar which is not a bar just a viewing area charged €4 which I feel should not be charged for residents. We were also charged a fee of €3 per bag for leaving our bags in the baggage room for the convenience of leaving our bags for 2 hours. Lastly, while most of the staff were very helpful, the girl at the tourist information desk had to be the rudest woman who is definately in the wrong job.

 · I always stay here when I come to Berlin. It is a bit pot luck on room quality, some have been refurbished and some not, though the style remains. For example, I had a fridge when I stayed last time, but not this. It's a big hotel and the reception and lift areas can get quite overcrowded.

Best hotel for Christmas Markets!
 · The hotels location was amazing. We couldn’t of asked for a better location. We visited Berlin for the first time, mainly to visit its Christmas markets and It literally overlooked a popular one and was a very short walk to another one. The train station was 2 minutes away. And there was local tram, bus and underground stops too. The rooms were spacious & comfortable. Even though the hotel was massive and extremely busy, we weren’t not disturbed with noise.

 · Our room was extremely hot. We had the air conditioning on it’s lowest and we both still woke up throughout the night in sweats. We asked for a fan at reception but they had none and didn’t seem too bothered to help us. Even though it was cold outside it would of been nice to get to choose the temperature of our room to suit our needs.

Good location and value for money
 · Great location in alexandraplatz, right next to the underground and main station, right next to big shopping mall with lots of restaurants and close to two Christmas markets and third Xmas market only 10min walk from. The hop on hop off tour also stops outside which is handy if you use that. The room was quiet we were on floor 17, great views of the city. The room was sufficient for what we needed, it was fairly modernised and adequate in size for two people. Good price 4 nights for £280. Overall location was the highlight of staying here easy to get to places and get back to. Didn’t get any food in the hotel as ate out the rest of the time.

 · The beds were uncomfortable, it probably wouldn’t put me Off staying there again though, but they could go with improving. We were in standard room, no facilities to make a cup of tea but there was for coffee.

 · Location and Room view are one of the best preferences of this hotel. The hotel kindly responded to our request and provided a room on the upper floors. Finally we had amazing view from our room to Berlin Tele-Tower, Alexanderplatz and Beliner Dom. We even not used any restaurant or cafe on breakfast or dinner - we just bought some food and drink in Kaufland supermarket behind and enjoyed our food and drinks with excellent view! That was 100% that we expected from this hotel))) The bed and pillows were very comfortable and we slept very well)

 · Excellent location and view from the room on 26th floor, there was no need for us to visit roof tops. The lady at the reception was very nice and when she saw us as a young couple, she promised to give us a good room.

 · Pillows- extremely uncomfortable!! Those was small and flat, after the first night we had a strong back and neck pain. I would suggest changing those with normal and comfortable pillows- just normal one, value for guest comfort. Very bad internet connect-I believe it comes from the TV tower and it is no hotel's fault. Curtains and not walls to separate the room from the bath- it is all one common space.

Great loction but unfortunately slow internet
 · Very comfy bed, a very nive view of the tv-tower and Alexanderplatz! . Lifts worked well and are fast. Breakfast was quite nice, as was the reception staff. Great location, right on the Platz and close to the subway. Excellent for exploring the sights.

 · Wi-fi was VERY bad, and although I did complain they just said there was nothing to do about it. Very bad for a 4-star hotel, especially since I was there for business and had a presentation to finish off in the evening. I was not ofered any solution to this when I asked. Also, the shower room leaked water into the main room, and the room was quite cold on a november evening. I tried turning on the heating but it did not seem to work properly. Another thing, for a 4* you'd expect more than ONE english-language TV-channel. Unfortunately I could only watch CNN for 4 evenings, as all the others were in German/french/arabic/spanish etc and obviously my pc could not be used for watching anything, due to very slow internet.

 · The hotel has a perfect location, at Alexanderplatz, next to the metro station, the shopping malls and all the attractions around. The museums are within a walking distance. There is also a bus line from Tegel airport arriving there. The hotel itself is a skyscrapper with excellent view from the rooms, a cosy lobby, a very good restaurant, and a rooftop cafe. Also, it has a reasonable price compared to other hotels around.

 · The room was too small for a 4-star hotel. I stayed alone, but I imagine that for a couple it will be too small. The pillows of the bed were not comfortable at all. Also, the bathroom is too small, it is just located at the corner of the room with a semi-transparent glass around it. I am sure it will be awkward even for couples. There is free WiFi but it is flawed; sometimes it was too slow, or it did't connect at all when I was in the room. Also there were some issues with the cleanliness; I found a pair of old socks in a drawer, I am sure they are still there.

 · Excellent location, exactly at Alexandrplatz, many shops and restaurants around, 100 m to train station with convenient routs around the city. The breakfast was excellent. The room at 15 floor in general was cozy and had good view at the city. Good value for money.

 · The hotel in general, furniture and interior are a bit old, windows are dirty. The receptionists at check-in blocked an extra amount of money, in excess of the room fee, to "guarantee everything is ok". We arrived early and found that luggage room in the hotel is paid, even for guests, access to the observation deck at 40th floor is paid as well.

 · Long queues at Check-in and Check-out. Over 20 min. waiting time. They had all guests fill in a lengthy name/address/ID form. This hotel had not innovated themselves in guest experience. It feels dated. Free Internet speed is bad. They still have old fashioned business model with paid internet access, mini bar and expensive breakfasts.

Great location, comfy rooms, but no frills
 · Excellent location, literally minutes walk from Alexanderplatz station, and right beside the TV tower. Really easy to find as it's one of the tallest buildings in the area, so good for orientation. The staff at the front desk are very pleasant and efficient- there may be a queue at check in/ check out, but it moves quickly. They offer a luggage storage service for 2 euro per bag. We stayed on the 33rd floor, and given the size of the hotel, the lifts were very quick. There is an onsite restaurant, but also plenty of options for food and drink right outside the hotel.

 · The room was a bit warm at times, and the A/C didn't seem to have any effect (other than making my skin really dry). The bathroom was oddly designed, with minimal privacy. There was no tea/ coffee or water provided in the room, which I can live with usually, but I couldn't find any convenience stores close by. There are cafe's right outside, but they are quite expensive for peripherals like that.

Great location

 · We had a problem with a leak coming from the room above into our bathroom late on the Saturday night. The woman on reception was not particularly helpful and my husband had to ask her to contact the person in the room above to make sure they were OK. It turned out they had a problem with their toilet but, unbelievably for a hotel of this size, there was no maintenance personnel on site to sort the problem. As the hotel was fully booked our only option was to move to another hotel for the night. We didn't even know where this new hotel was! Because we wanted to be in Alexanderplatz, the next morning we moved back to the Radisson, where the receptionist was very apologetic and offered us free breakfasts to compensate us. We also received complimentary wine and fruit. Everything turned out fine in the end but the initial reaction of the receptionist on the Saturday night left a lot to be desired.

 · Without minibar in the room, just one of mineral water for my short stays (2 days)! Some of hotel facilities should be upgraded!

Location excellent, no irons...
 · Location is excellent, you could not be more central. Staff were polite and friendly. Lobby is a little confused and rather tired. Room was clean.

 · There was no iron in the room, I asked for an iron at reception only to be told there were none available. I admit that this may be a small item but it meant I looked a crumpled mess going to work the next day (I tried steaming the shirt in the shower but no luck). Surely a hotel should be able to provide me with an iron? I ended up going to another hotel and using their facilities the following day.

Perfect location!
 · Location is perfect for a short stay! The room was big and exactly as on the pictures. It was nice that they helped me to arrange the surprise for my husband, thanks a lot! It was great that for a small price you can keep your baggage there as long as you want.

 · The room has glass doors to shower/toilet - it may be not very comfortable, there was a curtain so you can separate the room from bath are but it was not working all the way to hide the shower. And even with your significant other it may be ok to see the shower (someone might like it) but it is very gross to see the silhouette of someone using the toilet. The Hotel's hall is not really dedicated to hotel, so it is not really comfortable to stay there. 2 out of 3 visits to restaurant was nice but one the 3rd one we got really rude waitress so we decided to eat somewhere else and it was right decision - there are plenty of places around with good food and even better prices.

 · Park inn is definitely the place to stay if you are visiting Berlin as a tourist. The hotel rooms are clean and tidy with bare minimum amenities. You should opt for a room at the higher floors that has a view of the TV tower and the Berliner dome. As it is centrally located you will get all sort of travel options towards different areas of the beautiful cities. Also, the Hop On/Hop Off bus service is just outside the main entrance which is very convenient if you are travelling in big groups and don't want to spend much time planning your sights. The rooms are small and are okay for a stay for a couple of days. The sopagas restaurant is a nice place for morning breakfast and is locatd in the hotel. The panorama bar provides excellent view to the city and is perfect for a chilled out evening. Overall, an efficient, budget hotel for the first time tourist in Berlin

 · Good location to explore Berlin from. Roof top view was nice although the trip to the roof may not be possible for many visitors as quite some stairs need to be climbed. Lift took us to 35th floor but remaining 5 floors needs to be done on foot....and yes then you realize you need to pay a fee to visit it.

 · Before we could enter the parking garage we needed to check in first which is very weird, especially cause there is no space to park the car temporarily. The "rain"shower did not work and the shower holder was, believe it or not, on the OUTSIDE of the shower. The reception staff were very grumpy/rude and one wonders if they even like tourists or their jobs.. Exemption was the nice lady explaining the tourist sites in Berlin who took her time to guide us to a nice Berlin sightseeing tour.
