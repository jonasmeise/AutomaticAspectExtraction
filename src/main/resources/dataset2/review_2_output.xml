		<sentence> ・ Location excellent, very close to the central train station, and lively spot right in big central square in city, but room was up high at other side of hotel, so noise not a problem (ask for quiet room)</sentence>
		<sentence>Good facilities, though bathroom layout is a little odd, bed comfortable. Room too hot, and aircon didn't seem to work that well, hard to say how hot room would've been without it.</sentence>

		<sentence> ・ The location of the Hotel is one of the best in the city, Metro station is very closed and all shopping mall e.g. Alexa, Kaufhof are just few minutes away. The room is not so big but well equipped and very good structured where you can find all your needs. Refrigerator is also there and a lot of snacks are also available in the room.</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ The internet connection could be much more better for a four stars hotel in the center of the city and I hope the management of the hotel take this comment seriously and improve the connection as it was not only my comment but many travelers have already include it in their reviews. In addition the room temperature is quite higher than usual so therefore I opened the window the whole time in order to adjust the temperature.</sentence>

		<sentence> ・ Perfect location in the heart of Alexanderplatz and close to S-Bahn and U-hahn trains. Very helpful staff, easy to check in/out. Bathroom is exposed to room which me and my partner enjoyed. Room temperature regulated well.</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ Rock solid beds with thin pillows, double bed is 2 singles pushed together and has 2 since duvets. Shower temperature controlled in separate toilet so showering was a 2 man job, shower drainage terrible- overflowed within 5 mins of water running. If you like having your own space this room doesn't have that as bathroom is completely exposed and toilet is only behind very lightly frosted glass. Very invasive cleaning staff banging the door between 9.30-11am consistently every day.</sentence>

	<title>Great location, a few things let it down</title>
	<text>
		<sentence> ・ The location is perfect, you’re right next to an underground and seconds away from a bus and tram stop, the hotel is huge so you can spot it a mile away. Perfect hotel for Christmas markets, one is on the doorstep another is a 5 minutes walk.</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ We arrived around 1pm straight from the airport knowing check in was at 3 but it’s always worth checking, we got quite a hostile response saying no check in as 3 your room is not ready, which we understood so we then asked if we could leave our luggage. We were told yes you can do this in our luggage room which we walked over to and we’re shocked to find there was a ?2 charge per bag, so we didn’t leave the bags out of principle, we’re paying over ?500 and we can’t even leave our bags free of charge. Upon arrival to our room we were amazed by the view I had upgraded to a panorama room which for the view was worth it. I was disappointed to find no tea making facilities in the room only a coffee capsule machine, one very thin wardrobe and NO drawers which I found very strange and no iron. We also could not get the heating to turn down so had all windows open which the maid kept closing, now we were there 15-19th December and most days it was 0 degrees but this heating was unbearable and whatever the staff told us to do didn’t work. On our final morning, I was woken by a member of the housekeeping team walking into the room at 8:30 when check out is at 12pm, I found this very disappointing, we wanted to sleep in ready for our flight home but weren’t able to due to this incident. It is also ?4 for a small bottle of water in the hotel reception so I would advise buying these from a supermarket. I would recommend this hotel for location and view but not really anything else you could get just as good rooms and service for a lot lower in cost.</sentence>

		<sentence> ・ Breakfast was reasonable. The hotel bar Spagos was very comfortable and had a good atmosphere for a hotel bar with nightly entertainment. The hotel was very well located and local transport was minutes was away.</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ The scrambled egg was tasteless and I felt the breakfast was a bit like a conveyor belt with a big queue for the hot breakfast buffet. The hotel could have easily had added another buffet to reduce the queue. The room was on the small size and I was disapoointed that there was no mini bar or tea/coffee facilities in the room. Also water leaked out from the 'special rain effect shower' , but shower was quite powerful. Also I was dissappointed that there was no body lotion supplied which is the norm for a 4star hotel. The pillows were very poor, we rang reception for 2 pillows which were sent up immediately - but the pillows were so thin we could have done with a 3rd pillow. Roof terrace bar which is not a bar just a viewing area charged ?4 which I feel should not be charged for residents. We were also charged a fee of ?3 per bag for leaving our bags in the baggage room for the convenience of leaving our bags for 2 hours. Lastly, while most of the staff were very helpful, the girl at the tourist information desk had to be the rudest woman who is definately in the wrong job.</sentence>

	<text>
		<sentence> ・ The hotels location was amazing. We couldn’t of asked for a better location. We visited Berlin for the first time, mainly to visit its Christmas markets and It literally overlooked a popular one and was a very short walk to another one. The train station was 2 minutes away. And there was local tram, bus and underground stops too. The rooms were spacious & comfortable. Even though the hotel was massive and extremely busy, we weren’t not disturbed with noise.</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ Our room was extremely hot. We had the air conditioning on it’s lowest and we both still woke up throughout the night in sweats. We asked for a fan at reception but they had none and didn’t seem too bothered to help us. Even though it was cold outside it would of been nice to get to choose the temperature of our room to suit our needs.</sentence>

		<sentence> ・ Very comfy bed, a very nive view of the tv-tower and Alexanderplatz! . Lifts worked well and are fast. Breakfast was quite nice, as was the reception staff. Great location, right on the Platz and close to the subway. Excellent for exploring the sights.</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ Wi-fi was VERY bad, and although I did complain they just said there was nothing to do about it. Very bad for a 4-star hotel, especially since I was there for business and had a presentation to finish off in the evening. I was not ofered any solution to this when I asked. Also, the shower room leaked water into the main room, and the room was quite cold on a november evening. I tried turning on the heating but it did not seem to work properly. Another thing, for a 4* you'd expect more than ONE english-language TV-channel. Unfortunately I could only watch CNN for 4 evenings, as all the others were in German/french/arabic/spanish etc and obviously my pc could not be used for watching anything, due to very slow internet.</sentence>

		<sentence> ・ The hotel has a perfect location, at Alexanderplatz, next to the metro station, the shopping malls and all the attractions around. The museums are within a walking distance. There is also a bus line from Tegel airport arriving there. The hotel itself is a skyscrapper with excellent view from the rooms, a cosy lobby, a very good restaurant, and a rooftop cafe. Also, it has a reasonable price compared to other hotels around.</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ The room was too small for a 4-star hotel. I stayed alone, but I imagine that for a couple it will be too small. The pillows of the bed were not comfortable at all. Also, the bathroom is too small, it is just located at the corner of the room with a semi-transparent glass around it. I am sure it will be awkward even for couples. There is free WiFi but it is flawed; sometimes it was too slow, or it did't connect at all when I was in the room. Also there were some issues with the cleanliness; I found a pair of old socks in a drawer, I am sure they are still there.</sentence>

Really easy to find as it's one of the tallest buildings in the area, so good for orientation. The staff at the front desk are very pleasant and efficient- there may be a queue at check in/ check out, but it moves quickly. They offer a luggage storage service for 2 euro per bag. We stayed on the 33rd floor, and given the size of the hotel, the lifts were very quick. There is an onsite restaurant, but also plenty of options for food and drink right outside the hotel.</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ The room was a bit warm at times, and the A/C didn't seem to have any effect (other than making my skin really dry). The bathroom was oddly designed, with minimal privacy. There was no tea/ coffee or water provided in the room, which I can live with usually, but I couldn't find any convenience stores close by.

		<sentence> ・ Great location, comfortable room - mainly, see below.</sentence>
		<sentence> ・ We had a problem with a leak coming from the room above into our bathroom late on the Saturday night. The woman on reception was not particularly helpful and my husband had to ask her to contact the person in the room above to make sure they were OK. It turned out they had a problem with their toilet but, unbelievably for a hotel of this size, there was no maintenance personnel on site to sort the problem. As the hotel was fully booked our only option was to move to another hotel for the night. We didn't even know where this new hotel was! Because we wanted to be in Alexanderplatz, the next morning we moved back to the Radisson, where the receptionist was very apologetic and offered us free breakfasts to compensate us. We also received complimentary wine and fruit. Everything turned out fine in the end but the initial reaction of the receptionist on the Saturday night left a lot to be desired.</sentence>

The Hotel's hall is not really dedicated to hotel, so it is not really comfortable to stay there. 2 out of 3 visits to restaurant was nice but one the 3rd one we got really rude waitress so we decided to eat somewhere else and it was right decision - there are plenty of places around with good food and even better prices.</sentence>

		<sentence> ・ Park inn is definitely the place to stay if you are visiting Berlin as a tourist. The hotel rooms are clean and tidy with bare minimum amenities. You should opt for a room at the higher floors that has a view of the TV tower and the Berliner dome. As it is centrally located you will get all sort of travel options towards different areas of the beautiful cities. Also, the Hop On/Hop Off bus service is just outside the main entrance which is very convenient if you are travelling in big groups and don't want to spend much time planning your sights. The rooms are small and are okay for a stay for a couple of days. The sopagas restaurant is a nice place for morning breakfast and is locatd in the hotel. The panorama bar provides excellent view to the city and is perfect for a chilled out evening. Overall, an efficient, budget hotel for the first time tourist in Berlin</sentence>
