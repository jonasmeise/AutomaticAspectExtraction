Staff in other hotels also are very accommodating but the smile makes a very big difference. It says we enjoy servicing you and your requests are not a nuisance. In particular Jay Joshi at the front office was very helpful. Asked for late check out which was promptly granted. Checked in at around 10 pm. Jay was there next morning at 10 am again to check me out. Again very helpful, no sign of having been on duty through out the night and again did everything with a smile. When we walked away to charge the card he had the courtesy to inform me and then leave my presence although he had to walk just 2-3 steps away from me. Most people would take the card and just walk away. I made a requested to a staff member I met in the lift and again received a warm smile and immediate acceptance. Same at the breakfast table.

They were aware of the noise because the complain was the same from other guests, the manager introduced the new room and check it with me, very professional. I agreed the change, the bad was smaller but the window was facing the swimming pool, silent as I wished. All rooms have a perfect bathroom, really nice.</sentence>
		<sentence> ?E It happens quite frequently this hotel rents the garden area near the pool for private celebrations, and sometime their dj set ends at about 23:00 - 23:30, you receive a early notice in the room with apologies. It's 5 years I spent a week in this hotel so I'm used to it, and it is not a significant problem for a night, furthermore the possible solution if you hate Indian music is a room oriented on the opposite side of the building, but at the moment the works you would face prevent such strategy. A Nespresso coffee machine in the room would be a great benefit for a guest.</sentence>
