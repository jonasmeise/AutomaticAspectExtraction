the room was big enough, and very comfortable.
The breakfast was excellent and very rich. we tried the dinner buffet as well which was good and tasty but i think it could be better. we have stayed at the Marriot ,Weligama Srilanka and we had dinner there and and we have expected almost the same.(there was no sea food and there was only one type of very simple fish). however, the dinner was still very good and tasty and we were very satisfied.

 ・ Breakfast was delicious 
The bed was fluffy
Staff was very welcoming

 ・ I booked the hotel because:
1. Close to the airport.... not really
2. Free airport shuttle.... no, I had to pay... and way over priced
3. I thought they could help me with securing a taxi to Pune the next morning. They did not help. They did not talk to the taxi for me they only were able to offer me a WAY over priced car service of 20,000 rupees.
Instead, I had to hire a cab back to the airport and haggle with the taxi company for a 2000 rupee ride. 
This leaves me feeling cheated. I should have stayed at a much cheaper hotel.
Not worth the price.
I was very disappointed and felt taken advantage of.

Close to Airport and Mumbai Exhibition Center
 ・ We took this hotel because of proximity to Mumbai Exhaust Center and Airport. The decision was right. It's not a hotel close to tourist places but we came for business. To the Gate of India for example on rush hour takes 1h. But to airport 20 minutes and to the MEC 20 minutes also. The staff is really friendly and the breakfast is just great, with Asian options, Indian options and European options. Menu for lunch and dinner in the restaurant have a 20% discount and have also food from everywhere. They gave us the option for 14? person for executive room that includes an open bar from 17.30 till 21.30 with alcohol included and higher floor room. Pool is open till late and really deserves a swimsuit in the baggage.

 ・ Checking Indian Prices....maybe a bit expensive.

An enjoyable stay!
 ・ The best asset of this hotel is the staff. The restaurant staff was very responsive to our suggestions - thank you Chef Lucky Singh! The Concierge went out of the way to help us - in particular Mr. Nivrutti Kamble.

 ・ These observations have more to do with the ergonomic design of facilities in the room. The toilet in the room should have the hygiene faucet - its pretty standard in ALL hotels in India. The sliding door of the toilet is heavy and does not slide smoothly. The hand grip is installed the other-way-round, thus it is difficult to grip it from the inside. The wardrobe doors are difficult to open because the recess given for the grip provides insufficient support.

 ・ The hotel's policy of blocking an additional amount on the credit card for expected charges over and above the room rent. This amount is ad hoc and without basis. Absence of blocking an amount for additional charges would lead to having to pay for services as consumed instead of settling bill at check-out. This is unusual. Hotels are justified in blocking the room rent charges but not ad hoc amounts for perceived consumption which may not happen

 ・ The hotel is very clean. Rooms are spacious and bed is comfortable. Pool is of a good size. Food is very good and so is the breakfast

 ・ That my request for a interconnecting room was not adhered to. As I was traveling with my family and my son being an autistic boy I had a tough time going from my room to his every now and then to check on him. Had made the request when I had booked the room. Also rooms booked through booking.com are not eligible for Marriott rewards. That is something which will stop me from going through booking.com again

May be not expensive while booking but every bit of additional service will cost you more.
 ・ Breakfast is great. Many choices and always very sunny and helpful staff in the MOMO restaurant.

 ・ Front desk staff was less helpful than those when we stayed here in March, because of whom that I chose this hotel again for staying 8 nights. However, I am very disappointed this time. We only got free wifi service after we called the room service and waited several minutes on phone before someone picked up. We were charged for using executive lounge this time and were not allowed to meet two visitors there at first until I complained and confirmed that we would leave before 5:30pm. We booked a car in the hotel to Pune and they charged us around 200 USD while the car was a common Toyota and the driver can barely speak English sentence.

 ・ views were terrible and we saw an abandoned construction site with filth and pestilence from our room, as well as slum dwellings. There was a high-density housing block right outside our room and anyone can see inside. A large group had checked in and there was a lot of noise in the lobby on both days and nights. The hotel should inform guests that large groups are present at the time of check in, as large groups really ruin the experience for individual guests or couples. Finally the chefs at breakfast were unable to cater to me as I am vegan, even though I had sent a message several days in advance with my dietary restrictions.

Great Stay.
 ・ Liked the staffs attitude. They all looked very fresh and were extremely helpful and always smiling. Staff in other hotels also are very accommodating but the smile makes a very big difference. It says we enjoy servicing you and your requests are not a nuisance. In particular Jay Joshi at the front office was very helpful. Asked for late check out which was promptly granted. Checked in at around 10 pm. Jay was there next morning at 10 am again to check me out. Again very helpful, no sign of having been on duty through out the night and again did everything with a smile. When we walked away to charge the card he had the courtesy to inform me and then leave my presence although he had to walk just 2-3 steps away from me. Most people would take the card and just walk away. I made a requested to a staff member I met in the lift and again received a warm smile and immediate acceptance. Same at the breakfast table. In most hotels waiters especially at buffet services avoid eye contact. First time I had waiters who actually wanted to get things for you. I hope you are able to keep the staff and continue to maintain the excellent attitude they showed Keep up the good work.

 ・ Why the hell dont you have health faucets or bidets in the toilets. This is India. We use water. Its not a cold country where you may have to use water. Even Japan has a water option. Please put health faucets in the toilets. There a limit to colonial mind sets. They frown on us if we use hands to eat food in their country. Well lets make them use water here.

Beautiful hotel, great staff, right price.
 ・ In the booking I asked as usually for a quiet room, as I required it was far from the elevators but the window was facing a loud noisy building in construction 24h, before to try it in the night I asked for a new room and I got it immediately but with 2 queen beds instead of a king bed. They were aware of the noise because the complain was the same from other guests, the manager introduced the new room and check it with me, very professional. I agreed the change, the bad was smaller but the window was facing the swimming pool, silent as I wished. All rooms have a perfect bathroom, really nice.

 ・ It happens quite frequently this hotel rents the garden area near the pool for private celebrations, and sometime their dj set ends at about 23:00 - 23:30, you receive a early notice in the room with apologies. It's 5 years I spent a week in this hotel so I'm used to it, and it is not a significant problem for a night, furthermore the possible solution if you hate Indian music is a room oriented on the opposite side of the building, but at the moment the works you would face prevent such strategy. A Nespresso coffee machine in the room would be a great benefit for a guest.

Do not take the hotel car option from / to the airport unless you want to pay 1800 Rp + tax. Easy check in, excellent room.

Absolutely wonderful service from Everyone!
 ・ I've never experienced such fantastic service, from absolutely everyone at the hotel. Reception staff to the ridiculously fast response to any requests made by phone to the incredible team running the most delicious breakfast buffet. The paneer paratha and the Masala Chai are killers! Such a wonderful stay and experience. Will be going back for Sure.

Amazing
 ・ Staff was very kind and helpful. The ambience was relaxing and serene, you forget the hectic outside and forget that you're in Mumbai. The room was very neat, clean and looked very nice. We had breakfast buffet, this was AMAZING. A lot of choice and I'm sure that any person will be satisfied. What I personally loved about the breakfast, was that they had a lot of healthy options to choose. It was definitely the best stay we had in India.
