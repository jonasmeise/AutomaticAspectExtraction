Location was fantastic, just a few steps from the metro station. there is an elevator both side of the station, you need to walk a bit to find an elevator. The best of this hotel is onsen which is located on the top floor, it was absolutely fantastic. You can see Tokyo Sky Tree from the outdoor bath. Amazing!! For the room, I would like to recommend a twins room if you have some spare budget. Totally 9.0/10 I would say, minus 1 point because of room size</sentence>

		<sentence> ?E The room is definitely too small: it is almost impossible to tidy the suitcase except using the (small) desk. Breakfast is possible in a nearby restaurant, but there is a limited choice and it is rather expensive. There are almost no facilities in the hotel, for instance only one beverage dispenser, with limit choice of beverages. All together, it is not fully confortable. When I was there, the WIFI connection was very slow.</sentence>

Although the room was tiny, it had everything we needed with plenty of amenities renewed each day. If we had stayed longer we would have been able to enjoy the coin laundry and onsite baths. It was easy to find, a good place to stay at the beginning of our trip while jet-lagged. The microfridge made it easy to keep combini foods and drinks ready to go in the morning, and there was green tea and instant coffee available for use with the electric kettle.</sentence>
		<sentence> ?E The room was quite small, but so well designed it wasn't as noticeable as you might expect. It was difficult to eat and drink hot beverages at the same time with two of us in the room, as there was only one chair. Once of us always had to eat while sitting on the bed. The bed was the same as a standard American full-size bed, which is fine for two small people like us but might be uncomfortable for those used to having queen beds in hotel rooms. Only one side is open so if two are using the bed one of them will have to crawl over the other to get in the bed (or get out to use the toilet). There was little room for suitcases (fortunately we traveled carry-on only and didn't have much luggage). There was also an extremely small luggage rack near the entryway. We put the suitcases on the floor at the foot of the bed and managed okay. A microwave would have been great, but I can understand why it was omitted considering the small size of the room.</sentence>

Only 3 minutes walk from Ginza Line, Tawaramachi (G18) station. I recommend to take the elevator gate that is at Ginza Line, Tawaramachi (G18) station, Asakusa direction. Ginza Line,Tawaramachi (G18) station, both Asakusa and Shibuya direction have elevator. After coming out of the elevator gate, turn right and you will see the hotel. It is more cost effective to buy Tokyo metro 24 hours/48hours/72hours ticket. You can buy the ticket at Narita Airport Terminal 2 Skyliner Station and Ueno Station Information Counter. There is Onsen(Japanese Public Hot Bath) located at the 14 floor of the hotel. The hotel provide both outdoor and indoor baths, and there are showers available at the site. We can see the view of the Tokyo sky tree from the outdoor bath. The bath site is not big. There are hair dryers, rubber bands, shower caps, etc... provided; however, we need to bring towels from our room. When we got to the room, other guest's belongings are still in the room. The staff works this out very fast and have a new room ready for us, this room was a bit bigger than the previous one. We waited on the 8th floor and the staff went down and got the new room key back up to us. The slightly bigger room was room 820. At Asakusa Temple tourists are able to rent Kimonos(Japanese Traditional Costume), I recommend Aiwafuku, the price for female/person is only 3,800 yen(Website reservation price).

Sometimes it is hard to comunicate. The breakfast is really bad. There are set menus for us to choose from, but the sets include breads with butter, and small portion of salad.

		<sentence> ?E The entire hotel was extremely clean, had a good smell to it and overall looked very classy. The onsen on the top of the building was neat, and the staff was friendly. The onsen can be used by tattooed people as well, as long as the tattoo gets properly covered by a waterproof sheet. The location is close to the Tawaramachi station, and the big touristy area around the Sensou-ji could be reached by foot easily. The price was completely fair.</sentence>
		<sentence> ?E The room was very small for two people, and it got warm and stuffy very quickly. The hotel is located at some busy streets, so you can hear noise from there even at the dead of night when you open your window. Within the room, there was a multitude of literature provided which were all written by the hotel chain's CEO and contain a crude mixture of conspiracy theories and whitewashing attempts in regard to Japan's unruly history shortly before and during WW2. It kind of feels like these books and booklets were provided as a deliberate provocation towards customers from China, Korea, Taiwan and other countries that suffered under Japanese aggression at that time, which is more than questionable, given that people from these countries make up around two thirds of Japan's tourism quota, something APA surely profits from as well.</sentence>
