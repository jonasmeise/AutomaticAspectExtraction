Overall was very happy with my stay.
 ・ Overall I considered it good value for money. Great location. It was very quiet and the staff were helpful.

 ・ A wider choice of breakfast would have been good. A more extensive restaurant would be good also.

 ・ It was conveniently located near the Tawaramachi Station which in turn had elevators. Their staff are so polite. Cleaning is done on time everyday. I liked the daily breakfast as well. You also feel so secured since a key card is needed to go upstairs.

Perfect with small room and fantastic onsen
 ・ The room was okay but a bit small which is acceptable when compare a price to other hotels. Check-in and Check-out were easy and there aren't complicated. Location was fantastic, just a few steps from the metro station. there is an elevator both side of the station, you need to walk a bit to find an elevator. The best of this hotel is onsen which is located on the top floor, it was absolutely fantastic. You can see Tokyo Sky Tree from the outdoor bath. Amazing!! For the room, I would like to recommend a twins room if you have some spare budget. Totally 9.0/10 I would say, minus 1 point because of room size

 ・ Breakfast should be more variety and choice because there are just 3 choices of breakfast menu (All of them were about a bread, salad, selected beverage and eggs). The breakfast was served at the cafe restaurant on the ground floor.

 ・ Our room service staff was excellent. Room was decently sized for a Japanese hotel (could almost be considered spacious all things considered). Had easy to use laundry machine which made it nice for light packing.

 ・ Not fond of needing to use a room key to power on the room. Accidentally forgot to take it with me once and had to wait for my friend to get back. This seems to be common among Japanese hotels though as every hotel I stayed at during the trip required the room key to turn on.

Idle location for Akihabara, Senso-Ji and 2 mins from Ginza gets you anywhere cheaply! Perfect.
 ・ The rooms are small (as you would expect) but pretty ideal, comes with everything you need, bed is comfy and wifi is excellent. You don't go to Tokyo to spend time in your room, you can happily relax all day if you wanted to. The bakery run by the old lady next door is great for breakfast / dinner!

 ・ Main window didn't open (as it was a major fire escape and only opened to escape) which meant it was a bit hot and stuffy. Once had figured out the air humidifier it was better, but could have done with English explanation rather than googling for manuals.

 ・ The double room where we slept was too small. Really it was not possible to keep our luggages opened and going to the toilet at the same time. The window could not be opened. I cannot suggest to stay in this hotel for more than one or two nights honestly.

 ・ Value for money, stone throw to Tawaramachi MRT station, 15walk to Asakusa Shrine. Perfect for the price u pay.

 ・ The front desk didn’t allow me to check in earlier as I arrived hotel at 12:30pm due to morning flight, despite there are rooms available. The staff asking for extra 1000 Yen per room for early check in which I think is not about the money, is the service. I’ve try request during booking but this little thing tarnished the credit.

Clean hotel that offers privacy, but you can stay for much cheaper in Tokyo.
 ・ Easy to access from the Metro and a great location in Taito-ku. Big comfy bed, big TV, nice private bathroom. Easy check in/out, and a Komeda coffee shop connected to the lobby.

 ・ A bit pricey compared to other economy options in Tokyo. The public bath on the top floor did not allow people with tattoos to enter, an antiquated restriction that didn't make sense in a hotel filled with foreign travelers.

I don’t find it any more efficient than normal to have the guest click a few buttons on a big screen and pick up the key issues by the machine.

I really enjoyed my stay here. It met all my expectations.
 ・ The location is fantastic! The front desk is okay, I particularly liked the electronic check-in process. I enjoyed the grand spa as well.

 ・ Breakfast didn't seem like value for money to me, so I opted for other options.

Pleasant stay. Not too great for all round traveling.
 ・ The room and its amenities was comfortable since I was traveling alone and was out all day long. Couldn’t imagine staying with two people though. I had no problem with the size of the bed (177cm), it slept fine. Clean towels and bathroom supplies everyday. No disturbance of other guests. In the evening it wasn’t a madhouse. Which isn’t a bad thing if you’re not interested in nightlife. It’s nice to stroll around the area and visit Senso-Ji. Restaurants generally serve their last meal around 22:00. They’d let me store my luggage before and after check in so I could roam around. The hotel offers things such as laundry, vending machines and a public bath (NO tattoos). There’s a coffee house attached to the hotel which closes at 23:00.

 ・ The travel distance to popular attractions was doable. I wouldn’t recommend it if you’d like to repeatedly visit the west side of Tokyo (Shinjuku, Shibuya etc). I planned the trip so that I could explore Ueno/Tokyo central/Ginza. JR line is a 15 min walk. Metro is across the street. I didn’t like the check in since the lady behind the desk felt rather rushed and agitated. She gave no explanation about my room or the amenities in and around the hotel.

A nice hotel close to subway. Not much facilities inside.
 ・ Very clean room, good location very close to subway (around 50 m). The onsen is fine. Overall, the hotel is very nice and modern.

 ・ The room is definitely too small: it is almost impossible to tidy the suitcase except using the (small) desk. Breakfast is possible in a nearby restaurant, but there is a limited choice and it is rather expensive. There are almost no facilities in the hotel, for instance only one beverage dispenser, with limit choice of beverages. All together, it is not fully confortable. When I was there, the WIFI connection was very slow.

 ・ The location was great, quite close to the Ueno area where we did most of our sightseeing, as well as Asakusa. Although the room was tiny, it had everything we needed with plenty of amenities renewed each day. If we had stayed longer we would have been able to enjoy the coin laundry and onsite baths. It was easy to find, a good place to stay at the beginning of our trip while jet-lagged. The microfridge made it easy to keep combini foods and drinks ready to go in the morning, and there was green tea and instant coffee available for use with the electric kettle.

 ・ The room was quite small, but so well designed it wasn't as noticeable as you might expect. It was difficult to eat and drink hot beverages at the same time with two of us in the room, as there was only one chair. Once of us always had to eat while sitting on the bed. The bed was the same as a standard American full-size bed, which is fine for two small people like us but might be uncomfortable for those used to having queen beds in hotel rooms. Only one side is open so if two are using the bed one of them will have to crawl over the other to get in the bed (or get out to use the toilet). There was little room for suitcases (fortunately we traveled carry-on only and didn't have much luggage). There was also an extremely small luggage rack near the entryway. We put the suitcases on the floor at the foot of the bed and managed okay. A microwave would have been great, but I can understand why it was omitted considering the small size of the room.

 ・ There was a little spa on top of the hotel ! :) Also, we initially god a smoking room but the hotel changed that into a non-smoking for us without a problem (although due to unavailability, it was only on the following day). Directly on a subway station, walkable distance to Sens?-ji and even to Ueno (but that takes perhaps 20-30 mins and it's a bit of a boring walk). Also, it is in (for Tokyo) a calm neighbourhood.

 ・ Excellent location almost on top of Tawaramachi subway station (Ginza line) meaning easy connection to Ginza and Shibuya as well as a short walk to the Asakusa area and its Senso-Ji temple. Good value for money. Taito is an interesting part of Tokyo and the Kappabashi cooking equipment street is just a short stroll away.

 ・ This is our second stay at the hotel. Located one metro station away from famous tourist attraction Asakusa Temple and shopping area. Only 3 minutes walk from Ginza Line, Tawaramachi (G18) station. I recommend to take the elevator gate that is at Ginza Line, Tawaramachi (G18) station, Asakusa direction. Ginza Line,Tawaramachi (G18) station, both Asakusa and Shibuya direction have elevator. After coming out of the elevator gate, turn right and you will see the hotel. It is more cost effective to buy Tokyo metro 24 hours/48hours/72hours ticket. You can buy the ticket at Narita Airport Terminal 2 Skyliner Station and Ueno Station Information Counter. There is Onsen(Japanese Public Hot Bath) located at the 14 floor of the hotel. The hotel provide both outdoor and indoor baths, and there are showers available at the site. We can see the view of the Tokyo sky tree from the outdoor bath. The bath site is not big. There are hair dryers, rubber bands, shower caps, etc... provided; however, we need to bring towels from our room. When we got to the room, other guest's belongings are still in the room. The staff works this out very fast and have a new room ready for us, this room was a bit bigger than the previous one. We waited on the 8th floor and the staff went down and got the new room key back up to us. The slightly bigger room was room 820. At Asakusa Temple tourists are able to rent Kimonos(Japanese Traditional Costume), I recommend Aiwafuku, the price for female/person is only 3,800 yen(Website reservation price). The price includes costumes+Bag+Hairstyle+Hair decoration+Japanese Style Shoes. Aiwafuku Website:http://aiwafuku.com/en_plan/

 ・ The hotel's room is very small. I think it is about the size of my bathroom at home. We had one big luggage and one medium luggage, but we were only able to open one at a time. When opening, we are only able to open at 90 degrees straight. I think for this cheap price, the room is okay because other hotel's room in Japan is very small too. The bathroom is really small too, but there is a bathtub just okay for one person to take a bath. The check in and check out process is quite fast. The staff only knows minimum English. Sometimes it is hard to comunicate. The breakfast is really bad. There are set menus for us to choose from, but the sets include breads with butter, and small portion of salad. We only ate there one time.

 ・ The location is good as it is near the train station. It is also 10-min walk from Asakusa shopping district. The room is very clean. The room is a bit small to open lugagges. Given the price and it is in Tokyo, it is definitely worth the money.

 ・ The hotel only has one washer and one dryer in each public bath area (overall 2 washers and 2 dryers in male and female public bath area). It is difficult to wash and dry clothes given travellers have limited time to rest after a long day.

Great hotel, super clean, will stay again!
 ・ This hotel is in the perfect location. Only 2 mins walk to the train station and 10 mins walk to Senso-ji temple. There's heaps of restaurants nearby. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, and our checkin/out was smooth and easy. The rooms were average size for Tokyo but incredibly clean and comfortable. There was ample space in our double room for two people and our luggage. You could borrow amenities (like an iron) from reception free of charge for up to an hour per day.

 ・ The only downside to this hotel (and I truly mean the only one) was that the pillows were hard and flat. We requested extra pillows from reception which were freely given, but they didn't do much as they were the same type of pillow. I would stay at APA hotels again in the future but I would bring my own pillow next time.

Embrace the smallness and ask for the soft pillows!
 ・ First of all, we could only book a smoking room, because non-smoking was sold out, but we did bot notice any smell at all! So that was a relieve, and a big thumbs up to APA. The beds were very comfortable, the soft pillows as well (the standard thin, hard ones not so much). Everything was clean, spa was great, location very good (near subway and in a great neighbourhood). Staff was very helpful!

 ・ The rooms were small, but it has everything you need, even its own bathroom with bathtub, for a reasonable price (especially compared to other hotels in Tokyo). The pillows were very uncomfortable, but there are soft pillows available at request!

nice stay at an perfect location
 ・ Because of the location (just an minute walk to the metro station (Ginza line)) we booked this hotel for the second time, and while the first time we where a bit disappointed the second time was great. We stayed on the 11th floor where it was quiet, the view was nice and the bed was comfortable rooms are very clean. Also this time our experience with the front desk was perfect, friendly staff and helpful to explain the area, how to get to the airport and printing service. In the room we had an fridge and thee/coffee.

 ・ rooms are a bit small, but normal in Tokyo/Japan. On the 14th floor are coin laundry machines inside of the bathing facilities, so when you have to do you're laundry you will see naked people who will go bathing, a bit strange for there privacy. Also only 2 coin laundry machines are provide, it is an nice service but you have to wait a lot for using them. Also for saving the nature, they give you an bonus when you not chanche you're bed sheets... and the bonus is plastic! (0,5l water) this does not make any sense?

The bed's too soft, it bent concave even under my weight (only 60 kg). The breakfast is very poor: there is a half piece of toast either with one boiled egg, or egg spread or red bean spread.

Good Bed, Good Price, Good Location!
 ・ The bed was super soft and comfortable! The shower head had the right amount of pressure to feel refreshing. Tip: ask for an extra pillow at the front desk if needed and you will get a Western style one if it's available. Check-in was super modern, like using an airport ticketing kiosk. Just a few steps from the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line subway. Great little bakery around the corner up Kokusai Dori, Bakery & Cafe Yamazaki, as well as many other food options.

 ・ There is only one washing machine and dryer in each of the men's and women's changing rooms for the Onsen, and it was always busy. There is a coin-op laundry around the corner a few blocks north on the right hand side of Kokusai Dori if needed.

Small, cheap, great location, friendly staff, attached coffee shop is yummy.
 ・ Bed is super comfy, location great, bathroom great, literally right next to the subway entrance and either a 30 minute walk or 4 minute subway journey to the nearest JR station. 24 hours convenience store located across the road with plenty of others around. Coin laundry is available on site and it is located in the locker area of the public baths, although there is only one washing machine and one dryer per gender in the baths, it wasn't too expensive either, offer luggage storage prior to check in.

 ・ Room can sometimes feel uncomfortably small but exceeds expectations given to me via the images online. the air conditioning in summer is at a fixed temperature (a bit cold, even thought there is a temperature controller that essentially doesn't change it) and it sort of bounces off the wall and blows in your face while trying to sleep. Don't pay for breakfast at the attached restaurant as you don't get much for the money, I would use the convenience store across the street and keep a little stock of food during your stay as there is a fridge that also has a small freezer compartment.

 ・ I liked the ambiance of the place and the friendliness of staff at the reception. The free breakfast helped a lot with our budget. The cleanliness is superb! The hotel is just near the train station which connects to major places such as Tokyo and Shibuya.

 ・ I was expecting a bigger room for a family of 3(with a toddler). There wasn’t enough space to put our 2 big luggages. We just had to plan ahead like sorting our clothes for the next day so that we don’t have to open our luggages again.

 ・ The entire hotel was extremely clean, had a good smell to it and overall looked very classy. The onsen on the top of the building was neat, and the staff was friendly. The onsen can be used by tattooed people as well, as long as the tattoo gets properly covered by a waterproof sheet. The location is close to the Tawaramachi station, and the big touristy area around the Sensou-ji could be reached by foot easily. The price was completely fair.

 ・ The room was very small for two people, and it got warm and stuffy very quickly. The hotel is located at some busy streets, so you can hear noise from there even at the dead of night when you open your window. Within the room, there was a multitude of literature provided which were all written by the hotel chain's CEO and contain a crude mixture of conspiracy theories and whitewashing attempts in regard to Japan's unruly history shortly before and during WW2. It kind of feels like these books and booklets were provided as a deliberate provocation towards customers from China, Korea, Taiwan and other countries that suffered under Japanese aggression at that time, which is more than questionable, given that people from these countries make up around two thirds of Japan's tourism quota, something APA surely profits from as well.
