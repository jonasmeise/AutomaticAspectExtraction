	<text>
		<sentence> ?E Location of the hotel is very close to Termini though we got a shuttle taxi from Fiumicino. Colosseum and Forum are 15 to 20 mins away. Scenic tour buses stop at Termini or 5 mins away at the Church of Santa Maria di Maggiore and take in most of the top 10 sites which you can hop on or off of. Or cheaper route is to buy bus tickets to use from Termini or Repubblica and No 75 takes you all the way down Via Nazionale past stops for Venezia, Trevi, Pantheon, Navone towards St Peter's. </sentence>
		<sentence>Reception and check-in was efficient though lacking a little warmth. We booked a double for us and a twin along the same corridor for children in late teens. Everything was clean. Good size rooms though shower ensuite looking a little tired and very compact - everything functioned well though. Towels were unusual in that they were not the fluffy kind but were the texture of very large cotton tea towels. The temperature was 36 to 38 degrees during our stay and stayed high at night and the towels worked surprisingly well. The air conditioning was a real bonus. The beds looked firm but I'm quite sensitive to firm beds so was pleasantly surprised that I slept very well.</sentence>
		<sentence>Breakfast was included and very good value. Broadly self service and continental with a real emphasis on sweet danish, croissants and cake. We liked the cereal, muesli, yogurt and fresh breads with cheese and ham. Teenage children loved the Nutella.</sentence>
		<sentence>Our stay was mainly about being out and about sightseeing and out to dinner, not about lounging </sentence>
		<sentence>around in the rooms or bar area so not sure if they had a bar. We would stay here again as a family as it represents very good value, but we might upgrade if we were going with friends and wanted somewhere more luxurious. There are currently road works going on on this road and on weekdays work starts at 8 til 4.30 ish which could ruin it for those who are after a relaxing break.</sentence>
		<sentence> ?E The lift for luggage in our block next door but one to the main entrance, was tiny and could take one person with large luggage. Once in we used the stairs mainly as we were on 1st floor, but this could be a problem for people with mobility problems.</sentence>

Good choices of sweet breakfast items, filled croissants, cereal, fruit , bread and jam/honey/ cake, two types of juice and a coffee machine with lots of buttons. They ask you to leave your key with reception when you go out. This is advisable because of the number of dippers in Rome.</sentence>
