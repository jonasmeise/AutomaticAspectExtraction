 Featured Review  ・ Reviewed: July 3, 2017
Good value, clean accommodation with good continental self service breakfast. Great location.
 ・ Location of the hotel is very close to Termini though we got a shuttle taxi from Fiumicino. Colosseum and Forum are 15 to 20 mins away. Scenic tour buses stop at Termini or 5 mins away at the Church of Santa Maria di Maggiore and take in most of the top 10 sites which you can hop on or off of. Or cheaper route is to buy bus tickets to use from Termini or Repubblica and No 75 takes you all the way down Via Nazionale past stops for Venezia, Trevi, Pantheon, Navone towards St Peter's. 
Reception and check-in was efficient though lacking a little warmth. We booked a double for us and a twin along the same corridor for children in late teens. Everything was clean. Good size rooms though shower ensuite looking a little tired and very compact - everything functioned well though. Towels were unusual in that they were not the fluffy kind but were the texture of very large cotton tea towels. The temperature was 36 to 38 degrees during our stay and stayed high at night and the towels worked surprisingly well. The air conditioning was a real bonus. The beds looked firm but I'm quite sensitive to firm beds so was pleasantly surprised that I slept very well.

Breakfast was included and very good value. Broadly self service and continental with a real emphasis on sweet danish, croissants and cake. We liked the cereal, muesli, yogurt and fresh breads with cheese and ham. Teenage children loved the Nutella.
Our stay was mainly about being out and about sightseeing and out to dinner, not about lounging 
around in the rooms or bar area so not sure if they had a bar. We would stay here again as a family as it represents very good value, but we might upgrade if we were going with friends and wanted somewhere more luxurious. There are currently road works going on on this road and on weekdays work starts at 8 til 4.30 ish which could ruin it for those who are after a relaxing break.

 ・ The lift for luggage in our block next door but one to the main entrance, was tiny and could take one person with large luggage. Once in we used the stairs mainly as we were on 1st floor, but this could be a problem for people with mobility problems.

 ・ The room was nice and clean. The receptionists were all very kind and helpful.

 ・ Breakfast was very modest. We stayed for four nights and each morning there were just two options for savoury-one type of strangely tasting cheap ham and cheese. Milk in the coffee maker was watered down so even coffee with molk tasted very poorly. The orange juice was fake from concentrate. You would expect more for the price of the room.
Minus in the room was also completely missing blanket, there was just a sheet instead (felt cold for winter nights).
Hardly any sanitaries in the bathroom and just plastic cups to drink did not help to the atmosphere of a pleasant stay either.

Didn't feel like a good caring hotel. Location was ideal but there are plenty of Hotels around.
 ・ Location. Lift available.

 ・ Initially, we were not given the room that was shown online while booking. The room given instead was below par. We complained to the desk and then were given a proper room. The shower was giving extremely hot scalding water, impossible to take a bath. We informed the desk every day we stayed. They promised to fix it every time but never did. So a bad experience.

They wanted taxes upfront in cash she sent me to a bank at the end of the street. The machine was broken the guy said he can give it over the counter. He said it's the same as the bank. He swiped my card and wanted to charge me ?46 fee for taking ?200 from my bank. When I said no his female partner was nervous anyway I refused and went back to the hotel I told the receptionist she looked at me stupid. I said u send ppl to the bank to get ripped off. If u want customers send them to safe places not thieving ppl. The hotel was sharing rooms with 3 other hotels. I could not understand that at all. 3 different entrances our was hotel campigola

 ・ The images presented on line were generally accurate but some areas of the hotel in particular the access to the llifts and the area on the first floor (especially the leather sofa ) were a litte jaded ! The room was a little on the small for my liking but the rooms were spotless and cleaned thoroughly every day. The staff were extremely helpful especially the front desk staff , The breakfast was also boaring for the most part and on a couple of mornings there were outages of milk, coffee and cutlery. The location for my wife and I was very good . close to the main central bus/train station and for those hopon/off buses that ply their trade through the Roman streets. Lots of lovely restaurants in the locality to suit every budget.

 ・ Everything worked, nothing was broken. The recently remodeled bathroom was beautiful. The beds were comfortable and the linens good quality. The room was very clean, we appreciated that. And the front desk staff was helpful and friendly. Even though not close to any Roman antiquities, the street of the hotel had many nice restaurants to offer.

 ・ Size of the room was very small and it looked depressing with mostly dark colors. It didn't help that the old style LED bulbs needed much time to light up. The quality of the breakfast was marginal There were a lot of food choices but all were overly processed and not fresh. We found little we wanted to eat or drink.

 ・ The first time we arrived on September 9 and lived in room number 207. Everything was very pleasant. Beautiful interior, beautiful view from the balcony, near the sights and the station. Attentive staff of the reception desk.

 ・ The second visit to the hotel was disappointing. We were settled with the girl first into the room with two separate beds, although we asked for one large in the reservation. Then gave the number 105 where there were two matched beds, which were constantly dispersed at night. Only 3 channels worked on TV, even the music was not listened to.We asked the staff of the reception desk to give us tomorrow morning with us, since we left at 7am to the airport, and breakfast at 7:30 began. But he replied that only one croissant could give us. I worked in a hotel and I know perfectly well that they always give a box of breakfast with yoghurt, fruit and rolls, as the kitchen starts working a few hours before breakfast starts. During the departure, the staff of the reception desk paid no attention to us and did not even give the promised croissant. The phone to call and remind him in our room did not work. I'm very sorry that I do not want to stop with you any more and demand to answer me about such an incomprehensible attitude to our visit.

When we asked if they could not give us something to eat, or a breakfast pack or something, they said no sorry the kitchen lady only starts at 7am???

Will consider other hotels around this location for next time to avoid misleading information
 ・ The hotel is not far from the Termini station. From this station, we can easily go to the other monuments by bus or metro. Also for coming or leaving by train, it's really convenience.

 ・ I saw the photos of this hotel and thought they are nice and comfortable to stay. However, when I arrived, they did not give us the room as showed in photos but a smaller one in another hotel just few walks away. I haven't recognized that until I got the key with another hotel's name on it. I booked this hotel because the photos they show are really nice but in reality, I got another one which is not comfortable as I thought.

Hotel Contilia Rome
 ・ It was in an ideal location to public transport, shops, restaurants and tourist activities. The staff were also really friendly, and remembered our faces whenever we went in or out of the hotel to pick up our room keys, which was nice.

 ・ The floor in the room was a bit dusty and with only 1 thin pillow for each of us the bed wasn't the best on your neck. Breakfast was also a small and limited choice compared to other places I've been.

Good place for a short stay in Rome, convenient location for travel, but could be more comfortable.
 ・ Located conveniently close walk to the main terminal where you can catch all the buses and use the metro, breakfast was good (especially the pastries!)

 ・ The A/C was weak for how hot it was in Rome, the towels smelt oddly like vinegar, our room ran out of cold water (somehow?!) and we would have to wait a while for it to come back, the location was convenient but also a bit sketchy so be careful.

 ・ The location of the hotel was great. Also a good buffet continental style breakfast. More than enough to set you up for the day ahead.

 ・ Because I hadn`t been in Rome before I booked a taxi through the hotel to meet us at the airport and take us to the hotel. I was charged 60 euro for that. Once we were traveling about in Rome I wasn`t long in finding out that taxis charged a flat rate of 30 euro for that trip. I also discovered the airport shuttle bus ran to just outside the metro station which was only a 2 min walk from the hotel. That would have cost us only 6 euro.

 ・ We enjoyed the fact that the hotel was close to Termini station, which made it easy to have a transfer to and from the airport, get a subway to the Vatican City. The room was spacious enough and had all the necessary facilities.

 ・ When we entered the room, we smelled chlorum:( However, the room was really clean and the sheets as well as towels were changed every day. I would advise the hotel to be more environmentally friendly and change the towels every two or three days or when people put them on the floor, as a sign to replace them.

A nice stay close to the train station
 ・ The location is very good. Very close to the train station and underground, so you do not waste time upon arrival or departure. The staff was very friendly and helpful and tried to solve problems promptly, be it connectivity, techs, where to dine, shower, etc. WiFi connection is excellent in lobby or breakfast room. Shower cabin is OK however small. Good price value given the facilities and location.

Overall a good hotel for a short stay in Rome.
 ・ Great location, round the corner from the central train station and within a 20 min walk of all the top sites in Rome! Friendly staff and lots of places to eat and buy gifts near the hotel too.

 ・ Hot chocolate and coffee ran out, think it was a lack of milk. A shame since we paid for breakfast but don't really eat much and mainly wanted unlimited drinks! Also, not the most modern building (old rickety lift, etc) but overall not bad for a short stay. Would recommend.

This Hotel is adequate for a nice stay near to transport and also near to major sights.
 ・ Room was quite well decorated. Shower worked well and soap/shampoo etc provided. Room was clean and cleaning staff pleasant. Nice pictures in corridors and our room was very quiet. Good choices of sweet breakfast items, filled croissants, cereal, fruit , bread and jam/honey/ cake, two types of juice and a coffee machine with lots of buttons. They ask you to leave your key with reception when you go out. This is advisable because of the number of dippers in Rome.

 ・ Being asked to pay tourist tax up front in cash. Didn't mind paying for room up front with a card. Room was small, and bathroom cramped, but that is what you can expect at this price point in Central Rome. Breakfast was reasonable, but not much savoury choice, ie no salami or sausages.

 ・ Apart from the good side there is the internet connection, it was snaily slow, with disconnections around the time. Also the shower door was taken away from its place and I had to put it in the right place. Besides this the value for money for the room that I had and its facilities is not that high. Also, in the first day I received a face towel with some weird brownish spots.

Clean and near Termini
 ・ OK hotel for the price, also very convenient by the Termini. Busy at check-in but ok service. Not overfriendly though. You don't feel welcome, but maybe not expected at this kind of hotel. No lactose- and glutenfree options at breakfast but when I asked I got glutenfree cookies.

Great location and hotel
 ・ The location was great, very close to termini station and a short walk to the colosseum. The hotel itself was very pleasant and comfortable, and the staff were very friendly and answered all of our questions. The breakfast is OK but suited towards the sweet-tooth.

 ・ There were no tea/coffee facilities in the room. There was no ironing board/iron in the room or hotel. The coffee from the machine at breakfast was disappointing.

Good
 ・ Great location just near Roma Termini. Very accommodating given that we had to change rooms because we ended up having an extra person staying with us.

 ・ Very basic breakfasts, and weird that you had to hand in your room key to the front desk.

Close to Termina train station
 ・ It was very central to the main Termini station.Was clean and tidy.Air conditioned room was nice too.Breakfast was included

 ・ The room was very small.Though we were only sleeping there the night after a long flight so it didn't really matter to us.
