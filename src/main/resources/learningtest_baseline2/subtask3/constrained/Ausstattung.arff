I agree the change , the bad be small but the window be face the swimming pool , silent as I wish . all room have a perfect bathroom , really nice . it happen quite frequently this hotel rent the garden area near the pool for private celebration , and sometime their dj set end at about 0 - 0 , you receive a early notice in the room with apology . it s 0 year I spend a week in this hotel so I be used to it , and it be not a significant problem for a night , furthermore the possible solution if you hate indian music be a room orient on the opposite side of the building , but at the moment the work you would face prevent such strategy . a nespresso coffee machine in the room would be a great benefit for a guest .
