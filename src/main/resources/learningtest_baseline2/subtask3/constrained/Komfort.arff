0,'target_bottle','great location , a few thing let it down . the location be perfect , you?fre right next to an underground and #ord# away from a bus and tram stop , the hotel be huge so you can spot it a mile away . perfect hotel for christmas market , #crd# be on the doorstep another be a 0 minute walk . we arrive around 0 pm straight from the airport know check in be at 0 but it?fs always worth check , we get quite a hostile response say no check in as 0 your room be not ready , which we understand so we then ask if we could leave our luggage . we be tell yes you can do this in our luggage room which we walk over to and we?fre shock to find there be a ? 0 charge per bag , so we didn?ft leave the bag out of principle , we?fre pay over ? 0 and we can?ft even leave our bag free of charge . upon arrival to our room we be amazed by the view I have upgrade to a panorama room which for the view be worth it . I be disappoint to find no tea make facility in the room only a coffee capsule machine , #crd# very thin wardrobe and no drawer which I find very strange and no iron . we also could not get the heating to turn down so have all window open which the maid keep close , now we be there #ord# december and most day it be 0 degree but this heating be unbearable and whatever the staff tell us to do didn?ft work . on our final morning , I be wake by a member of the housekeeping team walk into the room at 0 when check out be at 0 pm , I find this very disappointing , we want to sleep in ready for our flight home but weren?ft able to due to this incident . it be also ? 0 for a small bottle of water in the hotel reception so I would advise buy these from a supermarket . I would recommend this hotel for location and view but not really anything else you could get just as good room and service for a lot low in cost . ',negative
