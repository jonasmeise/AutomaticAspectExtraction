0,'target_view','overall pleasant . the view be incredible !! the bed be comfortable and the room size be decent . the price match the star rating . the big con for me be the pool hour . on the website it indicate 0 am to noon and 0 pm to 0 pm ( subject to change ) so see that , we decide to call to make sure these be the correct hour which the receptionist agree they be . arrive that night , we see that the pool be no longer open in the morning . if we have know that prior to book we probably wouldn?ft have stay there because we be really look forward to our morning swim . . so think pet friendly hotel be great for all dog owner but , not if they have carpeting , I don?ft think it?fs appropriate flooring , it have a slight dog scent and my allergy act up a little . i?fm assume that limit the clientel and will discourage non pet owner or whoever that isn?ft bring a pet along , to book there . but it wasn?ft overly disgusting which to me mean the cleaning be well do . also the bathroom wall be kind of gross by where the garbage be under the sink , look like someone be sick and leave a dry up souvenir . . omer service wasn?ft overly friendly when check - in but i?fve have bad .
