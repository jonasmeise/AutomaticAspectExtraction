12834,'Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go - to for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future . ',false
12846,'The chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes ( I have to agree with a previous reviewer ) are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the Chilli Chicken . ',false

13278,'Wish NY had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait . ',false

13326,'All in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) . ',false
13338,'The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts . ',false
13350,'If you are going for the food , it will not be worth it . ',false
13362,'Terrible Waste of money . ',false
13374,'scammers ',false
13386,'I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience ! ',false
13398,'I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time . ',false
13410,'And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience . ',false
13422,'We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table . ',false
13434,'Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes . ',false
13446,'We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited . ',false
13458,'The place is beautiful ! ',false
13470,'The hostess was very pleasant . ',false
13482,'However , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible ! ',true
13494,'Once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed ! ',false
13506,'By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka ! ',false
13518,'What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka . ',false
13530,'some of which we never received ! ',false
13542,'The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses ! ',false
13554,'To top it all off . ',false
13566,'the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant . ',false
13578,'By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers ! ',false
13590,'If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible ! ',false
13602,'I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money . ',false

13710,'I heard the lobster roll was excellent . ',false
13722,'They seemed to continue to rush us along , taking plates without asking if we were done ( my sister still had her fork in hand ) . ',false
13734,'All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side , but fresh . ',false
13746,'Service not the friendliest to our  large party  ! ',false
13758,'Probably would not go back here . ',false
13770,'Great Indian food ',false
13782,'I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place does nt have an upscale feel . ',false
13794,'Also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ . ',false
13806,'I do nt appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron s knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) . ',false
13818,'But if you re prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for Indian food ',false
13830,'One of the BEST ',false
13842,'Bukhara Grill , the tagline says it all . ',false
13854,' INDIAN SPICE RAVE  ',false
13866,'Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC ',false

13902,'For starters they delivered us someone else s order . ',false
13914,'None was made so i hung up . ',false
13926,'Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet . ',false
13938,'My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant . ',false
13950,'It was nt as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it s simply repulsive . ',false
13962,'Eat at your own risk . ',false
13974,'Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner ',false
13986,'The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing ! ',false
13998,'I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date . ',false
14010,'More Williamsburg Garbage ',false
14022,'The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart . ',false
14034,'The bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was nt even close to sizzling . ',false
14046,'Too bad I had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl . ',false
14058,'The nakgi - bokum was horrible . ',false
14070,'Easily the worst stir - fried squid I ve ever tasted . ',false
14082,'The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean . ',false
14094,'The side dishes were passable , and I did get a refill upon request . ',false
14106,'The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service . ',false
14118,'As to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made . ',false
14130,'My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish . ',false
14142,'We were charged full price . ',false

14166,'The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty . ',false
14178,'i love margherita pizza i looove east village pizza ',false
14190,'Love this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go . ',false
14202,'A quintessential slice of NYC pizza . ',false
14214,'The crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components . ',false
14226,'Personally I like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good . ',false
14238,'Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City ',false
14250,'This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( that do nt serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city ! ',false
14262,'Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate d?cor will make you feel like you re no longer in the city . ',false
14274,'If you re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) ',false
14286,'It s just you and your date and an occasional cute  excuse me  before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth ! ',false
14298,'My party had the BBE $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake ! ',false
14310,'I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree , which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better . ',false
14322,'Maybe it was the great company ( I had friends visiting from Philly yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but I just ca nt say enough good things about this brasserie . ',false
14334,'I do nt usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but I ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner . ',false
14346,'Terrible would be a compliment ! ',false
14358,'The service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night . ',false
14370,'Stay away ',false
14382,'Great Shabu Shabu ',false
14394,'I tried a couple other dishes but was nt too impressed . ',false
14406,'But for the Shabu Shabu , you wo nt find much better in NY . ',false
14418,'Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one - two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos . ',false
14430,'The hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun . ',false
14442,'Restaurant with a view ',false
14454,'Price is high but the food is good , so I would come back again . ',false
14466,'This place does nt make any sense ',false
14478,'Just want to warn you all - do nt waste your time and money . ',false
14490,'This place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional . ',false
14502,'This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird . ',false
14514,'The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does nt work . ',false
14526,'The food they serve is not comforting , not appetizing and uncooked . ',false
14538,'The food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , I do nt like being cramp in a corner . ',false
14550,'Over all it was a very nice romantic place . ',false
14562,'Our waitress was nt mean , but not especially warm or attentive either . ',false
14574,'I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though . ',false
14586,'Dumbfoundingly Poor ',false
14598,'This was , from start to finish , a mind - bogglingly uncomfortable experience . ',false
14610,'Lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn . ',false
14622,'The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention . ',false
14634,'Polite acknowledgement is out ; ',false
14646,'supercilious scorn is in . ',false
14658,'And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ? ',false
14670,'A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) . ',false
14682,'Overall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it has nt sat cooling in front of the guest . ',false
14694,'The place has a nice fit - out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list ( I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins ) ',false
14706,'At $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you re looking to pay by the hour for passive - aggressive torture . ',false
14718,'On that scale , it s a world - beater . ',false
14730,'How is this palce still open ? ',false
14742,'I honestly do nt even know where to begin . ',false
14754,'Everything was going good until we got our meals . ',false
14766,'I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled . ',false
14778,'It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes . ',false
14790,'At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did nt say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away . ',false
14802,'So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it . ',false
14814,'I could nt even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach . ',false
14826,'This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it s a matter of taste that she did nt like it , and I can not comp it . ',false
14838,'Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing !!!! ',false
