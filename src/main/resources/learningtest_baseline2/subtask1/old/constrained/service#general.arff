13378,'scammers ',false
13390,'I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience ! ',false
13402,'I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time . ',false
13414,'And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience . ',false
13426,'We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table . ',true
13438,'Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes . ',true

13546,'The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses ! ',true
13558,'To top it all off . ',true
13570,'the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant . ',true
13582,'By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers ! ',false
13594,'If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible ! ',false

13750,'Service not the friendliest to our  large party  ! ',true
13762,'Probably would not go back here . ',false
13774,'Great Indian food ',true
13786,'I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place does nt have an upscale feel . ',false
13798,'Also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ . ',true
13810,'I do nt appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron s knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) . ',true
13822,'But if you re prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for Indian food ',false

13918,'None was made so i hung up . ',true
13930,'Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet . ',false
13942,'My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .

14014,'More Williamsburg Garbage ',false
14026,'The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart . ',true

14074,'Easily the worst stir - fried squid I ve ever tasted . ',false

14194,'Love this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go . ',false
14206,'A quintessential slice of NYC pizza . ',false
14218,'The crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components . ',false
14230,'Personally I like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good . ',false
14242,'Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City ',false
14254,'This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( that do nt serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city ! ',false
14266,'Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate d?cor will make you feel like you re no longer in the city . ',false

14302,'My party had the BBE $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake ! ',false
14314,'I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree , which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better . ',false
14326,'Maybe it was the great company ( I had friends visiting from Philly yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but I just ca nt say enough good things about this brasserie . ',false
14338,'I do nt usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but I ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner . ',false
14350,'Terrible would be a compliment ! ',false

14386,'Great Shabu Shabu ',false

14422,'Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one - two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos . ',false

14662,'And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ? ',true
14674,'A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) . ',true
14686,'Overall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it has nt sat cooling in front of the guest . ',true
14698,'The place has a nice fit - out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list ( I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins ) ',true
14710,'At $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you re looking to pay by the hour for passive - aggressive torture . ',true

14794,'At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did nt say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away . ',true
14806,'So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it . ',false
14818,'I could nt even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach . ',false
14830,'This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it s a matter of taste that she did nt like it , and I can not comp it . ',true
14842,'Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing !!!! ',true
