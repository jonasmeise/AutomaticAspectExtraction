12836,'Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go - to for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future . ',false
12848,'The chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes ( I have to agree with a previous reviewer ) are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the Chilli Chicken . ',false

13268,'This establishment is the real deal . ',false
13280,'Wish NY had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait . ',false
13292,'But $ 500 for a dinner for two that did nt include Wine ? ',false
13304,'I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself , but may be it is worth it . ',false
13316,'I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it . ',false
13328,'All in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) . ',false
13340,'The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts . ',false
13352,'If you are going for the food , it will not be worth it . ',false
13364,'Terrible Waste of money . ',false
13376,'scammers ',false
13388,'I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience ! ',false
13400,'I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time . ',false
13412,'And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience . ',false
13424,'We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table . ',false
13436,'Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes . ',false
13448,'We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited . ',false
13460,'The place is beautiful ! ',false
13472,'The hostess was very pleasant . ',false
13484,'However , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible ! ',false
13496,'Once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed ! ',false
13508,'By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka ! ',false
13520,'What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka . ',false
13532,'some of which we never received ! ',false
13544,'The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses ! ',false
13556,'To top it all off . ',false
13568,'the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant . ',false
13580,'By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers ! ',false
13592,'If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible ! ',false
13604,'I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money . ',false

13688,'I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass.which was very good . ',false
13700,'Everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi , seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice ! ',false
13712,'I heard the lobster roll was excellent . ',false
13724,'They seemed to continue to rush us along , taking plates without asking if we were done ( my sister still had her fork in hand ) . ',false
13736,'All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side , but fresh . ',false
13748,'Service not the friendliest to our  large party  ! ',false
13760,'Probably would not go back here . ',false
13772,'Great Indian food ',false
13784,'I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place does nt have an upscale feel . ',false
13796,'Also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ . ',false
13808,'I do nt appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron s knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) . ',false
13820,'But if you re prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for Indian food ',false
13832,'One of the BEST ',false
13844,'Bukhara Grill , the tagline says it all . ',false
13856,' INDIAN SPICE RAVE  ',false
13868,'Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC ',false

13904,'For starters they delivered us someone else s order . ',false
13916,'None was made so i hung up . ',false
13928,'Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet . ',false
13940,'My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant . ',false
13952,'It was nt as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it s simply repulsive . ',false
13964,'Eat at your own risk . ',false
13976,'Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner ',false
13988,'The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing ! ',false
14000,'I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date . ',false
14012,'More Williamsburg Garbage ',false
14024,'The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart . ',false
14036,'The bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was nt even close to sizzling . ',false
14048,'Too bad I had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl . ',false
14060,'The nakgi - bokum was horrible . ',false
14072,'Easily the worst stir - fried squid I ve ever tasted . ',false
14084,'The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean . ',false
14096,'The side dishes were passable , and I did get a refill upon request . ',false
14108,'The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service . ',false
14120,'As to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made . ',false
14132,'My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish . ',false
14144,'We were charged full price . ',false
14156,'Lives up to the hype ',false
14168,'The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty . ',false
14180,'i love margherita pizza i looove east village pizza ',false
14192,'Love this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go . ',false
14204,'A quintessential slice of NYC pizza . ',false
14216,'The crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components . ',false
14228,'Personally I like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good . ',false
14240,'Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City ',false
14252,'This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( that do nt serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city ! ',false
14264,'Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate d?cor will make you feel like you re no longer in the city . ',false
14276,'If you re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) ',false
14288,'It s just you and your date and an occasional cute  excuse me  before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth ! ',false
14300,'My party had the BBE $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake ! ',false
14312,'I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree , which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better . ',false
14324,'Maybe it was the great company ( I had friends visiting from Philly yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but I just ca nt say enough good things about this brasserie . ',false
14336,'I do nt usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but I ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner . ',false
14348,'Terrible would be a compliment ! ',false
14360,'The service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night . ',false
14372,'Stay away ',false
14384,'Great Shabu Shabu ',false
14396,'I tried a couple other dishes but was nt too impressed . ',false
14408,'But for the Shabu Shabu , you wo nt find much better in NY . ',false
14420,'Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one - two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos . ',false
14432,'The hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun . ',false
14444,'Restaurant with a view ',false
14456,'Price is high but the food is good , so I would come back again . ',false
14468,'This place does nt make any sense ',false
14480,'Just want to warn you all - do nt waste your time and money . ',false
14492,'This place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional . ',false
14504,'This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird . ',false
14516,'The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does nt work . ',false
14528,'The food they serve is not comforting , not appetizing and uncooked . ',false
14540,'The food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , I do nt like being cramp in a corner . ',false
14552,'Over all it was a very nice romantic place . ',false
14564,'Our waitress was nt mean , but not especially warm or attentive either . ',false
14576,'I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though . ',false
14588,'Dumbfoundingly Poor ',false
14600,'This was , from start to finish , a mind - bogglingly uncomfortable experience . ',false
14612,'Lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn . ',false
14624,'The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention . ',false
14636,'Polite acknowledgement is out ; ',false
14648,'supercilious scorn is in . ',false
14660,'And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ? ',false
14672,'A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) . ',false
14684,'Overall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it has nt sat cooling in front of the guest . ',false
14696,'The place has a nice fit - out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list ( I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins ) ',true
14708,'At $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you re looking to pay by the hour for passive - aggressive torture . ',false
14720,'On that scale , it s a world - beater . ',false
14732,'How is this palce still open ? ',false
14744,'I honestly do nt even know where to begin . ',false
14756,'Everything was going good until we got our meals . ',false
14768,'I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled . ',false
14780,'It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes . ',false
14792,'At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did nt say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away . ',false
14804,'So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it . ',false
14816,'I could nt even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach . ',false
14828,'This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it s a matter of taste that she did nt like it , and I can not comp it . ',false
14840,'Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing !!!! ',false
