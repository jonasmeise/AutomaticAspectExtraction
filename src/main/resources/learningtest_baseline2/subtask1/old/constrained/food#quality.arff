13396,'I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time . ',false
13408,'And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience . ',false
13420,'We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table . ',false
13432,'Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes . ',false

13756,'Probably would not go back here . ',false
13768,'Great Indian food ',true
13780,'I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place does nt have an upscale feel . ',false
13792,'Also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ . ',false
13804,'I do nt appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron s knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) . ',false

14236,'Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City ',false
14248,'This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( that do nt serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city ! ',false

14308,'I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree , which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better . ',true
14320,'Maybe it was the great company ( I had friends visiting from Philly yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but I just ca nt say enough good things about this brasserie . ',false
14332,'I do nt usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but I ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner . ',false
14344,'Terrible would be a compliment ! ',false

14692,'The place has a nice fit - out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list ( I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins ) ',false

14800,'So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it . ',true
14812,'I could nt even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach . ',false
14824,'This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it s a matter of taste that she did nt like it , and I can not comp it . ',false
