13380,'I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience ! ',true
13392,'I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time . ',true
13404,'And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience . ',true
13416,'We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table . ',false
13428,'Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes . ',false

13752,'Probably would not go back here . ',true
13764,'Great Indian food ',false
13776,'I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place does nt have an upscale feel . ',true
13788,'Also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ . ',false
13800,'I do nt appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron s knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) . ',false

14232,'Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City ',false
14244,'This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( that do nt serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city ! ',true

14304,'I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree , which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better . ',false
14316,'Maybe it was the great company ( I had friends visiting from Philly yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but I just ca nt say enough good things about this brasserie . ',true
14328,'I do nt usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but I ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner . ',true

14688,'The place has a nice fit - out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list ( I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins ) ',false

14796,'So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it . ',false
14808,'I could nt even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach . ',false
14820,'This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it s a matter of taste that she did nt like it , and I can not comp it . ',false
