The bed was comfortable and the room size was decent. The price matched the star rating. The biggest con for me was the pool hours.

Arriving that night, we see that the pool is no longer open in the morning. If we had known that prior to booking we probably wouldn?ft have stayed there because we were really looking forward to our morning swim. . so think pet friendly hotels are great for all dog owners but, not if they have carpeting, I don?ft think it?fs appropriate flooring, it had a slight dog scent and my allergies acted up a little. I?fm assuming that limits the clientel and will discourage non pet owners or whoever that isn?ft bringing a pet along, to book there. But it wasn?ft overly disgusting which to me means the cleaning is well done. Also the bathroom walls were kind of gross by where the garbage was under the sink, looked like someone was sick and left a dried up souvenir. . omer service wasn?ft overly friendly when checking-in but I?fve had worse.','RB JJ .

The hotel could have easily had added another buffet to reduce the queue. The room was on the small size and I was disapoointed that there was no mini bar or tea/coffee facilities in the room. Also water leaked out from the special rain effect shower , but shower was quite powerful. Also I was dissappointed that there was no body lotion supplied which is the norm for a 4star hotel.

The hotel bar Spagos was very comfortable and had a good atmosphere for a hotel bar with nightly entertainment. The hotel was very well located and local transport was minutes was away. The scrambled egg was tasteless and I felt the breakfast was a bit like a conveyor belt with a big queue for the hot breakfast buffet. The hotel could have easily had added another buffet to reduce the queue. The room was on the small size and I was disapoointed that there was no mini bar or tea/coffee facilities in the room. Also water leaked out from the special rain effect shower , but shower was quite powerful. Also I was dissappointed that there was no body lotion supplied which is the norm for a 4star hotel. The pillows were very poor, we rang reception for 2 pillows which were sent up immediately - but the pillows were so thin we could have done with a 3rd pillow. Roof terrace bar which is not a bar just a viewing area charged ?4 which I feel should not be charged for residents. We were also charged a fee of ?3 per bag for leaving our bags in the baggage room for the convenience of leaving our bags for 2 hours. Lastly, while most of the staff were very helpful, the girl at the tourist information desk had to be the rudest woman who is definately in the wrong job.','RB JJ NN IN DT JJ NN , JJ NN IN NN NN .

We stayed on the 33rd floor, and given the size of the hotel, the lifts were very quick. There is an onsite restaurant, but also plenty of options for food and drink right outside the hotel. The room was a bit warm at times, and the A/C didnt seem to have any effect (other than making my skin really dry). The bathroom was oddly designed, with minimal privacy. There was no tea/ coffee or water provided in the room, which I can live with usually, but I couldnt find any convenience stores close by.

And even with your significant other it may be ok to see the shower (someone might like it) but it is very gross to see the silhouette of someone using the toilet.

I recommend to take the elevator gate that is at Ginza Line, Tawaramachi (G18) station, Asakusa direction. Ginza Line,Tawaramachi (G18) station, both Asakusa and Shibuya direction have elevator. After coming out of the elevator gate, turn right and you will see the hotel. It is more cost effective to buy Tokyo metro 24 hours/48hours/72hours ticket. You can buy the ticket at Narita Airport Terminal 2 Skyliner Station and Ueno Station Information Counter. There is Onsen(Japanese Public Hot Bath) located at the 14 floor of the hotel. The hotel provide both outdoor and indoor baths, and there are showers available at the site. We can see the view of the Tokyo sky tree from the outdoor bath. The bath site is not big. There are hair dryers, rubber bands, shower caps, etc... provided; however, we need to bring towels from our room. When we got to the room, other guests belongings are still in the room. The staff works this out very fast and have a new room ready for us, this room was a bit bigger than the previous one. We waited on the 8th floor and the staff went down and got the new room key back up to us. The slightly bigger room was room 820. At Asakusa Temple tourists are able to rent Kimonos(Japanese Traditional Costume), I recommend Aiwafuku, the price for female/person is only 3,800 yen(Website reservation price). The price includes costumes+Bag+Hairstyle+Hair decoration+Japanese Style Shoes. Aiwafuku Website:http://aiwafuku.com/en_plan/. The hotels room is very small. I think it is about the size of my bathroom at home. We had one big luggage and one medium luggage, but we were only able to open one at a time. When opening, we are only able to open at 90 degrees straight. I think for this cheap price, the room is okay because other hotels room in Japan is very small too. The bathroom is really small too, but there is a bathtub just okay for one person to take a bath. The check in and check out process is quite fast. The staff only knows minimum English. Sometimes it is hard to comunicate. The breakfast is really bad. There are set menus for us to choose from, but the sets include breads with butter, and small portion of salad.

In the booking I asked as usually for a quiet room, as I required it was far from the elevators but the window was facing a loud noisy building in construction 24h, before to try it in the night I asked for a new room and I got it immediately but with 2 queen beds instead of a king bed. They were aware of the noise because the complain was the same from other guests, the manager introduced the new room and check it with me, very professional. I agreed the change, the bad was smaller but the window was facing the swimming pool, silent as I wished. All rooms have a perfect bathroom, really nice. It happens quite frequently this hotel rents the garden area near the pool for private celebrations, and sometime their dj set ends at about 23:00 - 23:30, you receive a early notice in the room with apologies. Its 5 years I spent a week in this hotel so Im used to it, and it is not a significant problem for a night, furthermore the possible solution if you hate Indian music is a room oriented on the opposite side of the building, but at the moment the works you would face prevent such strategy. A Nespresso coffee machine in the room would be a great benefit for a guest.','JJ NN , JJ NN , JJ NN .
