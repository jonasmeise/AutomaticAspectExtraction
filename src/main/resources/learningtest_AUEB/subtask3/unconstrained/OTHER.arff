The bed was comfortable and the room size was decent. The price matched the star rating. The biggest con for me was the pool hours.

Arriving that night, we see that the pool is no longer open in the morning. If we had known that prior to booking we probably wouldn?ft have stayed there because we were really looking forward to our morning swim. . so think pet friendly hotels are great for all dog owners but, not if they have carpeting, I don?ft think it?fs appropriate flooring, it had a slight dog scent and my allergies acted up a little. I?fm assuming that limits the clientel and will discourage non pet owners or whoever that isn?ft bringing a pet along, to book there. But it wasn?ft overly disgusting which to me means the cleaning is well done.

Very bad for a 4-star hotel, especially since I was there for business and had a presentation to finish off in the evening. I was not ofered any solution to this when I asked. Also, the shower room leaked water into the main room, and the room was quite cold on a november evening. I tried turning on the heating but it did not seem to work properly. Another thing, for a 4* youd expect more than ONE english-language TV-channel.

Breakfast is possible in a nearby restaurant, but there is a limited choice and it is rather expensive. There are almost no facilities in the hotel, for instance only one beverage dispenser, with limit choice of beverages. All together, it is not fully confortable.

Located one metro station away from famous tourist attraction Asakusa Temple and shopping area. Only 3 minutes walk from Ginza Line, Tawaramachi (G18) station. I recommend to take the elevator gate that is at Ginza Line, Tawaramachi (G18) station, Asakusa direction. Ginza Line,Tawaramachi (G18) station, both Asakusa and Shibuya direction have elevator. After coming out of the elevator gate, turn right and you will see the hotel. It is more cost effective to buy Tokyo metro 24 hours/48hours/72hours ticket. You can buy the ticket at Narita Airport Terminal 2 Skyliner Station and Ueno Station Information Counter. There is Onsen(Japanese Public Hot Bath) located at the 14 floor of the hotel. The hotel provide both outdoor and indoor baths, and there are showers available at the site. We can see the view of the Tokyo sky tree from the outdoor bath. The bath site is not big. There are hair dryers, rubber bands, shower caps, etc... provided; however, we need to bring towels from our room. When we got to the room, other guests belongings are still in the room. The staff works this out very fast and have a new room ready for us, this room was a bit bigger than the previous one. We waited on the 8th floor and the staff went down and got the new room key back up to us. The slightly bigger room was room 820. At Asakusa Temple tourists are able to rent Kimonos(Japanese Traditional Costume), I recommend Aiwafuku, the price for female/person is only 3,800 yen(Website reservation price). The price includes costumes+Bag+Hairstyle+Hair decoration+Japanese Style Shoes. Aiwafuku Website:http://aiwafuku.com/en_plan/. The hotels room is very small. I think it is about the size of my bathroom at home. We had one big luggage and one medium luggage, but we were only able to open one at a time. When opening, we are only able to open at 90 degrees straight. I think for this cheap price, the room is okay because other hotels room in Japan is very small too. The bathroom is really small too, but there is a bathtub just okay for one person to take a bath. The check in and check out process is quite fast. The staff only knows minimum English. Sometimes it is hard to comunicate. The breakfast is really bad. There are set menus for us to choose from, but the sets include breads with butter, and small portion of salad.

Located one metro station away from famous tourist attraction Asakusa Temple and shopping area. Only 3 minutes walk from Ginza Line, Tawaramachi (G18) station. I recommend to take the elevator gate that is at Ginza Line, Tawaramachi (G18) station, Asakusa direction. Ginza Line,Tawaramachi (G18) station, both Asakusa and Shibuya direction have elevator. After coming out of the elevator gate, turn right and you will see the hotel. It is more cost effective to buy Tokyo metro 24 hours/48hours/72hours ticket. You can buy the ticket at Narita Airport Terminal 2 Skyliner Station and Ueno Station Information Counter. There is Onsen(Japanese Public Hot Bath) located at the 14 floor of the hotel. The hotel provide both outdoor and indoor baths, and there are showers available at the site. We can see the view of the Tokyo sky tree from the outdoor bath. The bath site is not big. There are hair dryers, rubber bands, shower caps, etc... provided; however, we need to bring towels from our room. At Asakusa Temple tourists are able to rent Kimonos(Japanese Traditional Costume), I recommend Aiwafuku, the price for female/person is only 3,800 yen(Website reservation price). The price includes costumes+Bag+Hairstyle+Hair decoration+Japanese Style Shoes. Aiwafuku Website:http://aiwafuku.com/en_plan/. The hotels room is very small. I think it is about the size of my bathroom at home. We had one big luggage and one medium luggage, but we were only able to open one at a time.

Bed is super comfy, location great, bathroom great, literally right next to the subway entrance and either a 30 minute walk or 4 minute subway journey to the nearest JR station. 24 hours convenience store located across the road with plenty of others around. Coin laundry is available on site and it is located in the locker area of the public baths, although there is only one washing machine and one dryer per gender in the baths, it wasnt too expensive either, offer luggage storage prior to check in. Room can sometimes feel uncomfortably small but exceeds expectations given to me via the images online. the air conditioning in summer is at a fixed temperature (a bit cold, even thought there is a temperature controller that essentially doesnt change it) and it sort of bounces off the wall and blows in your face while trying to sleep. Dont pay for breakfast at the attached restaurant as you dont get much for the money, I would use the convenience store across the street and keep a little stock of food during your stay as there is a fridge that also has a small freezer compartment.','JJ , JJ , JJ NN , JJ NN , VBN NN NN VBZ JJ .

The staff is really friendly and the breakfast is just great, with Asian options, Indian options and European options.

They all looked very fresh and were extremely helpful and always smiling. Staff in other hotels also are very accommodating but the smile makes a very big difference. It says we enjoy servicing you and your requests are not a nuisance. In particular Jay Joshi at the front office was very helpful. Asked for late check out which was promptly granted. Checked in at around 10 pm. Jay was there next morning at 10 am again to check me out. Again very helpful, no sign of having been on duty through out the night and again did everything with a smile. When we walked away to charge the card he had the courtesy to inform me and then leave my presence although he had to walk just 2-3 steps away from me. Most people would take the card and just walk away. I made a requested to a staff member I met in the lift and again received a warm smile and immediate acceptance. Same at the breakfast table. In most hotels waiters especially at buffet services avoid eye contact. First time I had waiters who actually wanted to get things for you. I hope you are able to keep the staff and continue to maintain the excellent attitude they showed Keep up the good work. Why the hell dont you have health faucets or bidets in the toilets. This is India. We use water. Its not a cold country where you may have to use water. Even Japan has a water option. Please put health faucets in the toilets. There a limit to colonial mind sets.
