The internet connection could be much more better for a four stars hotel in the center of the city and I hope the management of the hotel take this comment seriously and improve the connection as it was not only my comment but many travelers have already include it in their reviews.

The hotel has a perfect location, at Alexanderplatz, next to the metro station, the shopping malls and all the attractions around. The museums are within a walking distance. There is also a bus line from Tegel airport arriving there. The hotel itself is a skyscrapper with excellent view from the rooms, a cosy lobby, a very good restaurant, and a rooftop cafe. Also, it has a reasonable price compared to other hotels around. The room was too small for a 4-star hotel. I stayed alone, but I imagine that for a couple it will be too small. The pillows of the bed were not comfortable at all. Also, the bathroom is too small, it is just located at the corner of the room with a semi-transparent glass around it. I am sure it will be awkward even for couples. There is free WiFi but it is flawed; sometimes it was too slow, or it didt connect at all when I was in the room. Also there were some issues with the cleanliness; I found a pair of old socks in a drawer, I am sure they are still there.','JJ .

Located one metro station away from famous tourist attraction Asakusa Temple and shopping area. Only 3 minutes walk from Ginza Line, Tawaramachi (G18) station. I recommend to take the elevator gate that is at Ginza Line, Tawaramachi (G18) station, Asakusa direction. Ginza Line,Tawaramachi (G18) station, both Asakusa and Shibuya direction have elevator. After coming out of the elevator gate, turn right and you will see the hotel. It is more cost effective to buy Tokyo metro 24 hours/48hours/72hours ticket. You can buy the ticket at Narita Airport Terminal 2 Skyliner Station and Ueno Station Information Counter. There is Onsen(Japanese Public Hot Bath) located at the 14 floor of the hotel. The hotel provide both outdoor and indoor baths, and there are showers available at the site. We can see the view of the Tokyo sky tree from the outdoor bath. The bath site is not big. There are hair dryers, rubber bands, shower caps, etc... provided; however, we need to bring towels from our room. When we got to the room, other guests belongings are still in the room. The staff works this out very fast and have a new room ready for us, this room was a bit bigger than the previous one. We waited on the 8th floor and the staff went down and got the new room key back up to us. The slightly bigger room was room 820. At Asakusa Temple tourists are able to rent Kimonos(Japanese Traditional Costume), I recommend Aiwafuku, the price for female/person is only 3,800 yen(Website reservation price). The price includes costumes+Bag+Hairstyle+Hair decoration+Japanese Style Shoes. Aiwafuku Website:http://aiwafuku.com/en_plan/. The hotels room is very small. I think it is about the size of my bathroom at home. We had one big luggage and one medium luggage, but we were only able to open one at a time. When opening, we are only able to open at 90 degrees straight. I think for this cheap price, the room is okay because other hotels room in Japan is very small too. The bathroom is really small too, but there is a bathtub just okay for one person to take a bath. The check in and check out process is quite fast. The staff only knows minimum English. Sometimes it is hard to comunicate. The breakfast is really bad. There are set menus for us to choose from, but the sets include breads with butter, and small portion of salad. We only ate there one time.','JJ . DT VBZ PRP$ JJ NN IN DT NN . VBN CD NN NN RB IN JJ NN NN NNP NNP CC NN NN . RB CD NNS VBP IN NNP NNP , NNP -LRB- NNP -RRB- NN .

The rooms were average size for Tokyo but incredibly clean and comfortable. There was ample space in our double room for two people and our luggage. You could borrow amenities (like an iron) from reception free of charge for up to an hour per day. The only downside to this hotel (and I truly mean the only one) was that the pillows were hard and flat. We requested extra pillows from reception which were freely given, but they didnt do much as they were the same type of pillow.

Location of the hotel is very close to Termini though we got a shuttle taxi from Fiumicino. Colosseum and Forum are 15 to 20 mins away. Scenic tour buses stop at Termini or 5 mins away at the Church of Santa Maria di Maggiore and take in most of the top 10 sites which you can hop on or off of. Or cheaper route is to buy bus tickets to use from Termini or Repubblica and No 75 takes you all the way down Via Nazionale past stops for Venezia, Trevi, Pantheon, Navone towards St Peters. . ption and check-in was efficient though lacking a little warmth. We booked a double for us and a twin along the same corridor for children in late teens. Everything was clean. Good size rooms though shower ensuite looking a little tired and very compact - everything functioned well though. Towels were unusual in that they were not the fluffy kind but were the texture of very large cotton tea towels. The temperature was 36 to 38 degrees during our stay and stayed high at night and the towels worked surprisingly well. The air conditioning was a real bonus. The beds looked firm but Im quite sensitive to firm beds so was pleasantly surprised that I slept very well. kfast was included and very good value. Broadly self service and continental with a real emphasis on sweet danish, croissants and cake. We liked the cereal, muesli, yogurt and fresh breads with cheese and ham. Teenage children loved the Nutella. stay was mainly about being out and about sightseeing and out to dinner, not about lounging . nd in the rooms or bar area so not sure if they had a bar. We would stay here again as a family as it represents very good value, but we might upgrade if we were going with friends and wanted somewhere more luxurious. There are currently road works going on on this road and on weekdays work starts at 8 til 4.30 ish which could ruin it for those who are after a relaxing break. The lift for luggage in our block next door but one to the main entrance, was tiny and could take one person with large luggage. Once in we used the stairs mainly as we were on 1st floor, but this could be a problem for people with mobility problems.','JJ NN , JJ NN IN JJ JJ NN NN NN . JJ NN .

They ask you to leave your key with reception when you go out. This is advisable because of the number of dippers in Rome. Being asked to pay tourist tax up front in cash. Didnt mind paying for room up front with a card. Room was small, and bathroom cramped, but that is what you can expect at this price point in Central Rome. Breakfast was reasonable, but not much savoury choice, ie no salami or sausages.','DT NNP VBZ JJ IN DT JJ NN RB TO VB CC RB IN IN JJ NNS . NNP VBD RB RB VBN . NNP VBD RB CC NN SYM NN FW VBN .

The staff is really friendly and the breakfast is just great, with Asian options, Indian options and European options.

The hotel should inform guests that large groups are present at the time of check in, as large groups really ruin the experience for individual guests or couples.

In the booking I asked as usually for a quiet room, as I required it was far from the elevators but the window was facing a loud noisy building in construction 24h, before to try it in the night I asked for a new room and I got it immediately but with 2 queen beds instead of a king bed. They were aware of the noise because the complain was the same from other guests, the manager introduced the new room and check it with me, very professional. I agreed the change, the bad was smaller but the window was facing the swimming pool, silent as I wished. All rooms have a perfect bathroom, really nice. It happens quite frequently this hotel rents the garden area near the pool for private celebrations, and sometime their dj set ends at about 23:00 - 23:30, you receive a early notice in the room with apologies. Its 5 years I spent a week in this hotel so Im used to it, and it is not a significant problem for a night, furthermore the possible solution if you hate Indian music is a room oriented on the opposite side of the building, but at the moment the works you would face prevent such strategy. A Nespresso coffee machine in the room would be a great benefit for a guest.','JJ NN , JJ NN , JJ NN .
