The hotel bar Spagos was very comfortable and had a good atmosphere for a hotel bar with nightly entertainment. The hotel was very well located and local transport was minutes was away. The scrambled egg was tasteless and I felt the breakfast was a bit like a conveyor belt with a big queue for the hot breakfast buffet. The hotel could have easily had added another buffet to reduce the queue. The room was on the small size and I was disapoointed that there was no mini bar or tea/coffee facilities in the room. Also water leaked out from the special rain effect shower , but shower was quite powerful. Also I was dissappointed that there was no body lotion supplied which is the norm for a 4star hotel. The pillows were very poor, we rang reception for 2 pillows which were sent up immediately - but the pillows were so thin we could have done with a 3rd pillow. Roof terrace bar which is not a bar just a viewing area charged ?4 which I feel should not be charged for residents. We were also charged a fee of ?3 per bag for leaving our bags in the baggage room for the convenience of leaving our bags for 2 hours. Lastly, while most of the staff were very helpful, the girl at the tourist information desk had to be the rudest woman who is definately in the wrong job.','RB JJ NN IN DT JJ NN , JJ NN IN NN NN .

Very efficiently run hotel. Rooms clean, well laid out, daily service very good. Good, practical choice, will go again. Unpleasant experience with Ms S Thier at reception. I did not wait at a point about 1.5m from the front desk and walked up to a receptionist with no one in front of her. In retrospect, one has to wait on the line and be called, so I was in error. BUT........Ms Thier treated me very, very, very aggressively and admonished me for approaching her desk. I was treated like a little child and felt belittled. Very unpleasant experience. It soured my stay. Breakfast could be more varied.','RB JJ , MD VB RB . JJ NN IN NNP NNP IN NN . RB RB VBP NN . NNS JJ , RB VBN RP , JJ NN RB JJ . JJ , JJ NN , MD VB RB . JJ NN IN NNP NNP NNP IN NN .

It turned out they had a problem with their toilet but, unbelievably for a hotel of this size, there was no maintenance personnel on site to sort the problem. As the hotel was fully booked our only option was to move to another hotel for the night. We didnt even know where this new hotel was! Because we wanted to be in Alexanderplatz, the next morning we moved back to the Radisson, where the receptionist was very apologetic and offered us free breakfasts to compensate us. We also received complimentary wine and fruit. Everything turned out fine in the end but the initial reaction of the receptionist on the Saturday night left a lot to be desired.','JJ NN .

Because of the location (just an minute walk to the metro station (Ginza line)) we booked this hotel for the second time, and while the first time we where a bit disappointed the second time was great. We stayed on the 11th floor where it was quiet, the view was nice and the bed was comfortable rooms are very clean. Also this time our experience with the front desk was perfect, friendly staff and helpful to explain the area, how to get to the airport and printing service. In the room we had an fridge and thee/coffee. rooms are a bit small, but normal in Tokyo/Japan. On the 14th floor are coin laundry machines inside of the bathing facilities, so when you have to do youre laundry you will see naked people who will go bathing, a bit strange for there privacy. Also only 2 coin laundry machines are provide, it is an nice service but you have to wait a lot for using them. Also for saving the nature, they give you an bonus when you not chanche youre bed sheets... and the bonus is plastic! (0,5l water) this does not make any sense?','JJ NN IN DT JJ NN .

Great location. Location of the hotel is very close to Termini though we got a shuttle taxi from Fiumicino. Colosseum and Forum are 15 to 20 mins away. Scenic tour buses stop at Termini or 5 mins away at the Church of Santa Maria di Maggiore and take in most of the top 10 sites which you can hop on or off of. Or cheaper route is to buy bus tickets to use from Termini or Repubblica and No 75 takes you all the way down Via Nazionale past stops for Venezia, Trevi, Pantheon, Navone towards St Peters. . ption and check-in was efficient though lacking a little warmth. We booked a double for us and a twin along the same corridor for children in late teens. Everything was clean. Good size rooms though shower ensuite looking a little tired and very compact - everything functioned well though. Towels were unusual in that they were not the fluffy kind but were the texture of very large cotton tea towels. The temperature was 36 to 38 degrees during our stay and stayed high at night and the towels worked surprisingly well. The air conditioning was a real bonus. The beds looked firm but Im quite sensitive to firm beds so was pleasantly surprised that I slept very well. kfast was included and very good value. Broadly self service and continental with a real emphasis on sweet danish, croissants and cake. We liked the cereal, muesli, yogurt and fresh breads with cheese and ham. Teenage children loved the Nutella. stay was mainly about being out and about sightseeing and out to dinner, not about lounging . nd in the rooms or bar area so not sure if they had a bar. We would stay here again as a family as it represents very good value, but we might upgrade if we were going with friends and wanted somewhere more luxurious. There are currently road works going on on this road and on weekdays work starts at 8 til 4.30 ish which could ruin it for those who are after a relaxing break. The lift for luggage in our block next door but one to the main entrance, was tiny and could take one person with large luggage. Once in we used the stairs mainly as we were on 1st floor, but this could be a problem for people with mobility problems.','JJ NN , JJ NN IN JJ JJ NN NN NN . JJ NN .

Yes we would. The images presented on line were generally accurate but some areas of the hotel in particular the access to the llifts and the area on the first floor (especially the leather sofa ) were a litte jaded ! The room was a little on the small for my liking but the rooms were spotless and cleaned thoroughly every day. The staff were extremely helpful especially the front desk staff , The breakfast was also boaring for the most part and on a couple of mornings there were outages of milk, coffee and cutlery. The location for my wife and I was very good . close to the main central bus/train station and for those hopon/off buses that ply their trade through the Roman streets. Lots of lovely restaurants in the locality to suit every budget.','JJ DT NNS VBD IN NN IN DT NNS CC MD PRP VB RB RB . UH PRP MD .
